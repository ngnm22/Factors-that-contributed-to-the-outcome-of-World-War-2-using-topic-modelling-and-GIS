"England', 24 April 1933, Royal Society of St George,
London",,"I am a great admirer of the Scots. I am quite friendly with the Welsh, especially one of them. I must confess to some sentiment about Old Ireland, in spite of the ugly mask she tries to wear. But this is not their night. On this one night in the whole year we are allowed to use a forgotten, almost a f(lrbidden word. We are allowed to mention the name of our own country, to speak of ourselves as 'Englishmen', and we may even raise the slogan 'St George for Merrie England'. We must be careful, however. You see these microphones? They have been placed on our tables by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Think of the risk these eminent men are running. We can almost see them in our mind's eye, gathered together in that very expensive building, with the questionable statues on its front. We can picture Sir John Reith, with the perspiration mantling on his lofty brow, with his hand on the control switch, wondering, as I utter every word, whether it will not be his duty to protect his innocent subscribers from some irreverent thing I might say about Mr Gandhi, or about the Bolsheviks, or even about our peripatetic Prime Minister. But let me reassure him. I have much more serious topics to discuss. I have to speak to you about St George and the Dragon. I have been wondering what would happen if that legend were repeated under modern conditions. St George would arrive in Cappadocia, accompanied not by a horse, but by a secretariat. He would be armed not with a lance, but with several flexible formulas. He would, of course, be welcomed by the local branch of the League of Nations Union. He would propose a conference with the dragon - a Round Table Conference, no doubt - that would be more convenient for the dragon's tail. He would make a trade agreement with the dragon. He would lend the dragon a lot of money for the Cappadocian taxpayers. The maiden's releasewould be referred to Geneva, the dragon reserving all his rights
meanwhile. Finally St George would be photographed with the
dragon (inset - the maiden).
There are a few things I will venture to mention about England.
They are spoken in no invidious sense. Here it would hardly occur to
anyone that the banks would close their doors against their
depositors. Here no one questions the fairness of the courts of law
and justice. Here no one thinks of persecuting a man on account of
his religion or his race. Here everyone, except the criminals, looks on
the policeman as the friend and servant of the public. Here we
provide for poverty and misfortune with more compassion, in spite
of all our burdens, than any other country. Here we can assert the
rights of the citizen against the State, or criticise the Government of
the day, without failing in our duty to the Crown or in our loyalty to
the King. This ancient, mighty London in which we are gathered is
still the financial centre of the world. From the Admiralty building,
half a mile away, orders can be sent to a Fleet which, though much
smaller than it used to be. or than it ought to be, is still unsurpassed
on the seas. More than 80 per cent of the British casualties of the
Great War were English. More than 80 per cent of the taxation is
paid by the English taxpayers. We are entitled to mention these facts,
and to draw authority and courage from them.
Historians have noticed, all down the centuries, one peculiarity of
the English people which has cost them dear. We have always
thrown away after a victory the greater part of the advantages we
gained in the struggle. The worst difficulties from which we suffer do
not come from without. They come from within. They do not come
from the cottages of the wage-earners. They come from a peculiar
type of brainy people always found in our country, who, if they add
something to its culture, take much from its strength.
Our difficulties come from the mood of unwarrantable selfabasement into which we have been cast by a powerful section of our
own intellectuals. They come from the acceptance of defeatist
doctrines by a large proportion of our politicians. But what have they
to offer but a vague internationalism, a squalid materialism, and the
promise of impossible Utopias?
Nothing can save England if she will not save herself. If we lose
faith in ourselves, in our capacity to guide and govern, if we lose our
will to live, then indeed our story is told. If, while on all sides foreign
nations are every day asserting a more agressive and militant
nationalism by arms and trade, we remain paralysed by our own
theoretical doctrines or plunged into the stupor of after-war exhaustion, then indeed all that the croakers predict will come true,
and our ruin will be swift and final. Stripped of her Empire in the
Orient, deprived of the sovereignty of the seas, loaded with debt and
taxation, her commerce and carrying trade shut out by foreign tariffs
and quotas, England would sink to the level of a fifth-rate Power,
and nothing would remain of all her glories except a population
much larger than this island can support.
Why should we break up the solid structure of British power,
founded upon so much health, kindliness and freedom, for dreams
which may some day come true, but are now only dreams, and some
of them nightmares? We ought, as a nation and Empire, to weather
any storm that blows at least as well as any other existing system of
human government. We are at once more experienced and more truly
united than any people in the world. It may well be that the most
glorious chapters of our history are yet to be written. Indeed, the very
problems and dangers that encompass us and our country ought to
make English men and women of this generation glad to be here at
such a time. We ought to rejoice at the responsibilities with which
destiny has honoured us. and be proud that we are guardians of our
country in an age when her life is at stake. "
"Wars come very suddenly', 7 February 1934, House of Commons",,"Wars come very suddenly. I have lived through a period when one looked forward, as we do now, with great anxiety and great uncertainty to what would happen in the future. Suddenly something did happen - tremendous, swift, overpowering, irresistible. Let me remind the House of the sort of thing that happened in 1914. There
was absolutely no quarrel between Germany and France. One July
afternoon the German Ambassador drove down to the Quai d'Orsay
and said to, I think, M. Viviani, the French Prime Minister: 'We have
been forced to mobilise against Russia, and war will be declared.
What is to be the position of France?' The French Prime Minister
made the answer, which his Cabinet had agreed upon, that France
would act in accordance with what she considered to be her own
interests. The Ambassador said, 'You have an alliance with Russia,
have you not?' 'Quite so,' said the French Prime Minister. And that
was the process by which, in a few minutes, the area of the struggle,
already serious in the East, was enormously widened and multiplied
by the throwing in of the two great nations of the West on either
side. But sometimes evep.. a declaration of neutrality does not suffice.
On this very occasion, as we now know, the German Ambassador
was authorised by his Government, in case the French did not do
their duty by their Russian ally, in case they showed any disposition
to back out of the conflict which had been resolved on by the
German nation, to demand that the fortresses of Toul and Verdun
should be handed over to German troops as a guarantee that the
French, having declared neutrality, would not change their mind at a
subsequent moment.
That is how the great thing happened in our own lifetime, and I
am bound to say that I canot see in the present administration of
Germany any assurance that they would be more nice-minded in
dealing with a vital and supreme situation than was the Imperial
Government of Germany, which was responsibile for this procedure
being adopted towards France. No, Sir, and we may, within a
measurable period of time, in the lifetime of those who are here, if we
are not in a proper state of security, be confronted on some occasion
with a visit from an ambassador, and may have to give an answer in
a very few hours; and if that answer is not satisfactory, within the
next few hours the crash of bombs exploding in London and the
cataracts of masonry and fire and smoke will warn us of any
inadequacy which has been permitted in our aerial defences. We are
vulnerable as we have never been before. I have often heard criticisms
of the Liberal Government before the war. It is said that its
diplomacy was not sufficiently clear and precise, that it wrapped
things up in verbiage, that it ought to have said downright and plain
what it would do, and there were criticisms about its lack of
preparation, and so forth. All I can say is that a far graver case rests
upon those who now hold power if, by any chance, against our wishes and against our hopes, trouble should come - a far graver
case.
N at one of the lessons of the past has been learned, not one of
them has been applied, and the situation is incomparably more
dangerous. Then we had the Navy, and no air menace worth
speaking of. Then the Navy was the 'sure shield' of Britain. As long
as it was ready in time and at its stations we could say to any foreign
Government: 'Well, what are you going to do about it? We will not
declare ourselves. We will take our own line, we will work out our
own course. We have no wish or desire to hurt anyone, but we shall
not be pressed or forced into any hasty action unless we think fit or
well.' We cannot say that now. This cursed, hellish invention and
development of war from the air has revolutionised our position. We
are not the same kind of country we used to be when we were an
island, only 20 years ago. That is the thing that is borne in upon me
more than anything else. It is not merely a question of what we like
and what we do not like, of ambitions and desires, of rights and
interests, but it is a qll~stion of safety and independence. That is what
is involved now as never before ....
I cannot conceive how, in the present state of Europe and of our
position in Europe we can delay in establishing the principle of
having an Air Force at least as strong as that of any Power that can
get at us. I think that is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. It would
only begin to put us hack to the position in which we were brought
up. We have lived under the shield of the Navy. To have an Air Force
as strong as the air force of France or Germany, whichever is the
stronger, ought to be the decision which Parliament should take, and
which the National Government should proclaim."
"Germany is arming', 8 March 1934, House of Commons",,"I dread the day when the means of threatening the heart of the British Empire should pass into the hands of the present rulers of Germany. I think we should be in a position which would be odious to every man who values freedom of action and independence, anAs we go to and fro in this peaceful country, with its decent orderly
people going about their business under free institutions, and with so
much tolerance and fair play in their laws and customs, it is startling
and fearful to realise that we are no longer safe in our island home.
For nearly a thousand years England has never seen the camp fires of
an invader. The stormy seas and our Royal Navy have been our sure
defence. Not only have we preserved our life and freedom through
the centuries, but gradually we have come to be the heart and centre
of an Empire which surrounds the globe. It is indeed with a pang of
stabbing pain that we see all this in mortal danger.
A thousand years scarce serve to form a State,
An hour may lay it in the dust ....
Only a few hours away by air there dwells a nation of nearly
seventy millions of the most educated, industrious, scientific, disciplined people in the world, who are being taught from childhood to
think of war and conquest as a glorious exercise, and death in battle
as the noblest fate for man. There is a nation which has abandoned
all its liberties in order to augment its collective might. There is a
nation which, with all its strength and virtues, is in the grip of a
group of ruthless men preaching a gospel of intolerance and racial
pride, unrestrained by law, by Parliament or by public opinion. It is
but twenty years since these neighbours of ours fought almost the
whole world, and almost defeated them. Now they are rearming with
the utmost speed, and ready to their hands is this new lamentable
weapon of the air, against which our Navy is no defence, befored also in a position of the utmost peril for our crowded, peaceful population, engaged in their daily toil. I dread that day, but it is not, perhaps, far distant. It is, perhaps, only a year, or perhaps eighteen months, distant. Not come yet - at least, so I believe, or I hope and pray. But it is not far distant. There is still time for us to take the necessary measures, but it is the measures we want. Not this paragraph in this White Paper; we want the measures. It is no good writing that first paragraph and then producing £130,000. We want the measures to achieve parity. The hon. Gentleman opposite who spoke so many words of wisdom seemed to me to mar the significance and point of his argument when he interposed in it the statement that he was not committing himself to any increase. Mr Mander: At this stage. Mr Churchill: But this is the stage. I do not say today, but within the next week or so. The turning-point has been reached, and the new steps must be taken .... The scene has changed. This terrible new fact has occurred. Germany is arming - she is rapidly arming - and no one will stop her. None of the grievances between the victors and the vanquished have been redressed. The spirit of aggressive nationalism was never more rife in Europe and in the world. Far away are the days of Locarno, when we nourished bright hopes of the reunion of the European family and the laying in the tomb of that age-long quarrel between Teuton and Gaul of which we have been the victims in our lifetime. That hope is gone, and we must act in accordance with the new situation."
"We lie within ... striking distance', 16 November 1934, Broadcast, London",,"As we go to and fro in this peaceful country, with its decent orderly people going about their business under free institutions, and with so much tolerance and fair play in their laws and customs, it is startling and fearful to realise that we are no longer safe in our island home. For nearly a thousand years England has never seen the camp fires of an invader. The stormy seas and our Royal Navy have been our sure defence. Not only have we preserved our life and freedom through the centuries, but gradually we have come to be the heart and centre of an Empire which surrounds the globe.

Only a few hours away by air there dwells a nation of nearly seventy millions of the most educated, industrious, scientific, disciplined people in the world, who are being taught from childhood to think of war and conquest as a glorious exercise, and death in battle as the noblest fate for man. There is a nation which has abandoned all its liberties in order to augment its collective might. There is a nation which, with all its strength and virtues, is in the grip of a group of ruthless men preaching a gospel of intolerance and racial pride, unrestrained by law, by Parliament or by public opinion. It is but twenty years since these neighbours of ours fought almost the whole world, and almost defeated them. Now they are rearming with the utmost speed, and ready to their hands is this new lamentable weapon of the air, against which our Navy is no defence, before which women and children, the weak and frail, the pacifist and the
jingo, the warrior and the civilian, the front line trenches and the
cottage home, lie in equal and impartial peril.
Nay worse still, for with the new weapon has come a new method,
or rather has come back the most brutish methods of ancient
barbarism, namely the possibility of compelling the submission of
races by terrorising and torturing their civil population. And worst of
all - the more civilised a country is, the larger and more splendid its
cities, the more intricate the structure of its social and economic life;
the more is it vulnerable, the more it is at the mercy of those who
may make it their prey.
At present we lie within a few minutes' striking distance of the
French, Dutch, and Belgian coasts, and within a few hours of the
great aerodromes of Central Europe. We are even within canon-shot
of the Continent. So close as that! Is it prudent, is it possible,
however we might desire it, to turn our backs upon Europe and
ignore whatever may happen there? Everyone can judge this question
for himself, and everyone ought to make up his mind about it
without delay. It lies at the heart of our problem. For my part I have
come to the conclusion - reluctantly I admit - that we cannot get
away. Here we are and we must make the best of it. But do not
underrate the risks - the grievous risks - we have to run.
I hope, I pray, and on the whole, grasping the larger hope, I
believe, that no war will fall upon us. But if in the near future the
Great War of 1914 is resumed again in Europe after the Armisticefor that is what it may come to - under different conditions no doubt
- no one can tell where and how it would end, or whether sooner or
later we should not be dragged into it, as the United States were
dragged in against their will in 1917. Whatever happened and
whatever we did, it would be a time of frightful danger for us ....
Therefore it seems to me that we cannot detach ourselves from
Europe, and that for our 0\'.Tn safety and self-preservation we are
bound to make exertions and run risks for the sake of keeping peace.
There are some who say - indeed it has been the shrill cry of the
hour - that we should run the risk of disarming ourselves in order to
set an example to others. We have done that already for the last five
years, but our example has not been followed. On the contrary, it has
produced the opposite result. All the other countries have armed only
the more heavily; and the quarrels and intrigues about disarmament
have only bred more ill-will between the nations. "
"'A corridor of deepening and darkening danger', 31 May 1935, House of Commons",,"I agree with Sir Herbert Samuel when he says that it is impossible for us, in the world in which we live, to treat with blank distrust the utterances of the Leader of so vast a State as Germany. To represent everything that has been said by Herr Hitler as only designed for the purposes of political manoeuvre would be to destroy the very means of contact and of parley between one great nation and another. I agree with him also in feeling that the Air Locarno, as it has been called, is in itself an eminently desirable objective towards which we should work, and which, if concluded, will be a matter of real substance and importance. I welcome, with him, any steps which may be taken to achieve, if possible, air parity at levels lower than those which are now mentioned. But it is not going to be very easy. I welcome also, and perhaps most keenly, what has been said by the German Chancellor stigmatising the vile crime of indiscriminate bombing of civilian populations. Naturally the Government will be encouraged by all sections in the House to pursue these matters with patience and not without hope. But do not let us underrate the difficulties which attach to them. There may be many more complications in what is called an Air Locarno than would appear at first sight. Still, for what it is worth, the union of great countries putting their names to a document pledging them all to bomb the bomber would be an event which everyone would hail. Even more difficulties attend the limitation of air armaments. Air armaments are not expressed merely by the air squadrons in existence or the aeroplanes which have been made; they cannot be considered apart from the capacity to manufacture. If, for instance, there were two countries which each had 1000 first-line aeroplanes, but one of which had the power to manufacture at the rate of 100 a month and the other at the rate of 1000 a month, it is perfectly clear that air parity would not exist between those two countries very long. One would imagine, sitting in this House today, that the dangers were in process of abating. I believe that the exact contrary is thetruth - that they are steadily advancing upon us, and that no one can
be certain that a time may not be reached, or when it will be reached,
when events may have passed altogether out of control. We must
look at the facts. Nourish your hopes, but do not overlook realities.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs [Sir John Simon]
dropped out a phrase today which really is in keeping with what I
call the illusion basis on which much of this discussion has
proceeded. It was one of those casual phrases which nevertheless
reveal an altogether unsound conception of the facts. He referred to
countries with whom you feel it your absolute duty to remain on
terms of air equality. Look at that. A 'duty to remain on terms of air
equality.' We have not got equality. Speeches are made in the country
by leading Ministers saying that we have decided that we must have
air equality, that we cannot accept anything less. We have not got it.
We are already decidedly inferior to Germany, and, it must be said,
of course to France. All that lies before us for many months is that
this inferiority becomes more and more pronounced. In the autumn
of this year, in Novembtr, when we are supposed to be 50 per cent
stronger, I hazard the melancholy prediction that we shall not be a
third, possibly not a quarter, of the German air strength. What is the
use of saying 'the countries with whom we consider it our absolute
duty to remain on terms of air equality'? This is one of the terrible
facts which lie before us and which will not be swept away merely by
following the very natural inclination which we all have to say that
they do not exist.
The German Army, already developed to twenty-one or twentytwo divisions, is working up to thirty-six as fast as it can, a division a
month or something like that coming into full mobilisation capacity,
tanks and the whole business. There is the Navy, and submarines
have been made. Some are actually, I believe, practising, training
their crews in that difficult art. Let me tell the House that submarines
can be manufactured very quickly. I remember in November 1914
arranging for Mr Schwab, of Bethlehem, to make twenty submarines
in what was then considered the incredibly short period of six
months. Although these vessels had to be shifted from the United
States to a Canadian dockyard for reasons of neutrality, it was
possible to put sections on the railway-trucks and to deliver them in
time. How do you know what progress has been made in
constructing such sections? The arms production has the first claim
on the entire industry of Germany. The materials required for the
production of armaments are the first charge on the German
exchange. The whole of their industry is woven into an immediate readiness for war. You have a state of preparedness in German
industry which was not attained by our industry until after the late
war had gone on probably for two years.
Besides this, there is tremendous propaganda, beginning with the
schools and going right through every grade of youth to manhood,
enforced by the most vigorous and harsh sanctions at every stage. All
this is taking place. It is a very nice comfortable world that we look
out on here in this country. It has found an apt reflection in this
Debate today, but it has no relation whatever to what is going
forward, and going forward steadily. Mark you, in time of peace, in
peace politics, in ordinary matters of domestic affairs and class
struggles, things blow over, but in these great matters of defence, and
still more in the field of actual hostilities, the clouds do not roll by. If
the necessary measures are not taken, they turn into thunderbolts
and fall on your heads. The whole of this great process of
psychological, moral, material and technical mobilisation of German
war power is proceeding ceaselessly and with ever-increasing
momentum.
It is the growth of German armaments which has fascinated and
petrified nation after nation throughout Europe. Just look at what
has happened in the last few weeks since we were last engaged in a
serious discussion on foreign affairs. We know perfectly well that
Poland continues in the German system. The Czechoslovakian
elections have created a new Nazi party in Czechoslovakia, which is,
I believe, the second party in the State. [19 May.] That is a very
remarkable fact, having regard to the energy which the German
people, when inspired by the Nazi spirit, are able to exercise. The
Austrian tension increases. Many people talk about guaranteeing the
independence of Austria, but guaranteeing that Austria will be kept
separate from Germany is a different thing. You may at any time be
faced with the position that the will of the Austrian people will be
turned in the reverse direction from that which our policy has
hitherto proclaimed. There is the Danubian tour of General Goering.
He has been to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and to Hungary. He has, in
Hungary and Bulgaria, been renewing those old ties of comradeship
and confidence which existed between them and Germany in the
days of the war. In Yugoslavia undoubtedly his presence has
exercised a very important influence there as a counter-influence to
others that may be brought to bear. Everywhere these countries are
being made to look to Germany in a special way, and let me say that
I read in The Times on the 30th of Maya significant telegram from
Vienna dealing with this tour of General Goering, which finished up with these words: 'In the circumstances the strength and clarity of
German policy gains by contrast' - that is, to the Allied policy - 'and
the waverers among the smaller States are closely watching events.'
There is the question of the relations between Germany and Japan.
It seems to me that that is a matter which must be in the thoughts of
everyone who attempts to make an appreciation of the foreign
situation. There are the difficulties of Italy's preoccupation with
Abyssinia. There are the obvious stresses through which France is
passing, not, indeed, in the matter of national defence, but in almost
every other aspect of the life of that people. There is our own
weakness in the air which is to become worse and worse month after
month. All this is going forward.
It is easy, then, for Herr Hitler and the German Government to
pursue a policy which I have heard described as 'power diplomacy'.
What a transformation has taken place in the last two or three years!
Two or three years ago it was considered sentimental, intellectual,
liberally minded, to speak words of encouragement and compassion,
and even to speak patfOnisingly of the German people, and to seek
opportunities of making gestures to raise them up to more and greater
equality with other countries. Now we see them with their grievances
unredressed, with all their ambitions unsatisfied, continuing from
strength to strength, and the whole world waits from week to week to
hear what are the words w·hich will fall from the heads of the German
nation. It is a woeful transformation which has taken place.
It would be folly for us to act as if we were swimming in a halcyon
sea, as if nothing but balmy breezes and calm weather were to be
expected and everything were working in the most agreeable fashion.
By all means follow your lines of hope and your paths of peace, but
do not close your eyes to the fact that we are entering a corridor of
deepening and darkening danger, and that we shall have to move
along it for many months and possibly for years to come. While we
are in this position, not only have we our own safety to consider, but
we have to consider also whether the Parliamentary Governments of
Western Europe, of which there are not many that function in the
real sense of the word, are going to be able to afford to their subjects
the same measure of physical security, to say nothing of national
satisfaction, as is being afforded to the people of Germany by the
dictatorship which has been established there. It is not only the
supreme question of self-preservation that is involved in the
realisation of these dangers, but also the human and the world cause
of the preservation of free Governments and of Western civilization
against the ever-advancing forces of authority and despotism. "
"'You have unsettled everything ... ', 5 June 1935, House of Commons",,"You have unsettled everything. You have settled nothing. Those
whom you have sought to conciliate are those whom you have most
offended. Those to whom your mission is most necessary are those
whom you have most entirely abandoned. Those on whom you have
to count most are those whom you are teaching least of all to count
on you.
You must ask one final question - the greatest of all these
questions. Does this Bill mean a broadening of Indian life, a widening
and elevation of Indian thought? Does it mean that the Indian toiler
when he rises to his daily task will have a better chance of, in the
words of the American Constitution, 'life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness'? India is a COU!ltry, almost a continent, which responded
to the influence of British peace, order and justice and all the
applications of modern science, only by an increase of population.
There has been a tremendous increase of population there. New
wealth, new food, new facilities for locomotion, new hygiene, new
canals, improvement in forestry and agriculture have not made the
Indian masses better off. They have only brought into being in the
last 50 years 100,000,000 more souls in India. A gigantic population
has remained, upon the whole, at a very low level of human
subsistence, but has become much more numerous.
Such a vast helpless mass requires extra British guidance, higher efficiency of government, more British civil servants and a stricter
and more vigorous administration in all technical matters. All you
offer them are liberal formulas, administrative relaxation and
decline. The huge machine of Indian government is to be allowed to
slow down, just at the time when the inhabitants of India have
multiplied far beyond the limit of their basic food supply, just at the
time when they require, above all things, a far higher measure of
disinterested and enlightened autocracy. Just at that very time you
offer this bouquet of faded flowers of Victorian Liberalism which,
however admirable in themselves, have nothing to do with Asia and
are being universally derided and discarded throughout the continent
of Europe.
Mr Isaac Foot: So much the worse for Europe.
Mr Churchill: For this bouquet they have to pay a heavy price.
Money raised by taxes in India which, like the salt tax, draw
exactions from the poorest of the poor, from people whose poverty is
inconceivable even to the poorest of the poor in this country - this
money is needed and its extraction is only justified if it is used for
hospitals, for plague p:.-evention, for technical education, for
improved irrigation and other modern apparatus. Only in this way
can a population which is one-sixth of the human race be kept at its
present artificial level of numbers. In the standard of life they have
nothing to spare. The slightest fall from the present standard of life in
India means slow starvation, and the actual squeezing out of life, not
only of millions but of scores of millions of people who have come
into the world at your invocation and under the shield and
protection of the British power ....
You have decided and you have the power. You have shown you
have the power to force this through, and no doubt you have the
power to force it upon the people of India. But it now appears that
even these political classes are not satisfied with the government
which you are going to give to them, with the constitution which you
offer, or with the sacrifice which the Indian masses are to be asked to
give. By every organ through which they can express their views, they
reject your government and they spit upon your ill-conceived
generosity, if generosity it be. Even the very classes of wealthy, small,
unrepresentative minorities for whom you have set out to cater, have
rejected the dish which you proffer to them.
This, then, is your plan for the better Government of India. We
thank God that we have neither part nor lot in it. You have done
what you like. You have now a harder thing before you, and that is
to like what you have done. Only the years can make their proof of whether you will be successful in that or not. What has astounded me
is that the Government should have pressed forward so obstinately
with this Indian policy, which causes so much distress to many
important elements in the Conservative party, at a time when the
domestic political situation is so uncertain, when the Continent of
Europe is drifting steadily nearer to the brink of catastrophe, when
we have before us for so many months to come that awful hiatus in
our air strength and in the vital defences of Great Britain. I should
have thought that common prudence alone would have led them to
make some modification of their plans which are admittedly
makeshift, which conform to no logic or symmetry, which are not
fixed by any agreement or treaty with any elements in Indian public
life. It has astonished me that that has not occurred to them ....
I think it is a shortsighted Act. I am sure it is a wrongful Act. It is,
to use the words of my Noble Friend, a fraud upon power and a
malversation of political trust. "
"'I am a Treaty man', 10 July 1935, House of Commons",,"I am a Treaty man. I am one of the signatories to the Irish Treaty. We have the great advantage that we are a self-contained British Parliament, but there were terrible arguments on the other side. At any rate, we signed this Treaty and Irishmen died to make it good and to keep it as a great instrument guiding our future relations. No one can possibly impugn the conduct of Great Britain. But what has the Senate, the last remaining vestige of the action of the Crown and
the Governor-General, the right of appeal to the Privy Council, and
the new law which makes a British subject a foreigner in the Free
State if a proclamation is made under the Act.
The whole of this great transition has speedily transformed. the
Ireland we settled with as a Dominion within the Empire but with the
full rights of the Canadian Dominion into an alien republic. The
whole of that great transition has taken place during these four years
in which we have had our own troubles to worry about, and no one
has concerned himself with it. But there it is. It is not complete. There
are a few remaining steps to be taken but not many. They are going
to be taken. The whole of this thing is going to happen. Let me point
out that it has been perfectly legal. When you passed that Statute of
Westminster and when the Chief Whip assembled for the first time
his mighty legions returned at the General Election and rolled them
through the Lobby over the 50 who stood out on that occasion,
when that happened and a refusal was made by the Government to
exempt the Irish Treaty from the operations of the Statute, when that
happened you regularised every necessary step, every necessary step
that has been taken and may he taken in the future, to destroy and
sweep away every vestige of the Treaty made between the two
countries.
I have no doubt that we shall hear from the hon. and learned
Gentleman speaking from the benches of the Labour party that de
Valera has acted only within his legal rights. He may have broken
every kind of good faith between nation and nation, and every kind
of agreement between man and man, and made it quite clear that the
word of Ireland entered into by people who were his colleagues and
with whom he worked in bygone days is not of consequence to him,
and that he has been the injured party for all time and that the small
nations and the good faith of small nations has been impugned. But
that is not a matter that affects the issue. He is legally entitled, as I
understand, according to highest authority, to take all the steps he
has done, and when we were advised he would not be so legally
advised, we were voted down when we did not accept that.
I do not hesitate to draw a moral, which the House will quite
readily accept from me, that in this great Indian Constitution Bill
there are a great many things on which you have been advised by
legal authority and of which the House has accepted the opinion
which, when you come to look at their working out in practice year
after year, will be found equally fallacious and equally injurious to
what has occurred in Ireland, and injurious upon a far more immense happened to the Treaty now? It has been broken and repudiated. My right hon. Friend and the Dominions Secretary unfolded to the House part of that dismal catalogue of repudiation which has marked scale in the history of the world and in the wealth and strength of this
country. We are bound to draw attention to the past because it is the
guide, and the only guide we have, to the immediate future, and we
are bound to say that Ministers who were giving all these airy
assurances about Ireland have repeated them during the whole
course of this vast Indian Constitution Bill.  the last four years - the oath of allegiance, the abolition of"
"'Naval security', 24 July 1935, Harlow",,"We are approaching a General Election of the utmost consequence. If a wrong decision is taken it Vlould certainly be disastrous and might be fatal. The election might result in a Socialist Government, and I cannot think of anything that would be more disastrous. In 1931 they reduced a wealthy, powerful Empire to the appearance of bankruptcy and ran away from their duty in the hour of need. The Government have been aroused to take action with the air policy, and they also propose to build a larger Navy. I was present at the recent naval review and it was a fine sight, but it was an extraordinary experience to me, who, as First Lord, was at another naval review 20 years ago. Out of 17 ships, including two aircraftcarriers, 14 were ships for which I was responsible during the years in which I was in office. Both in the air and in the Navy we will have to make substantial preparations to put ourselves in a state of security."
"Abyssinia has been invaded', 8 October 1935, Chingford",,"Since I spoke in the City of London things have become more serious, but also more simple. The outlook is lamentable, but we can discern its features more plainly. We know where we are and what we are going to do, and we also know what we are not going to do. We can see the limits of our immediate commitments and dangers. The overwhelming mass of the nation and all parties in it are broadly agreed in supporting the policy of his Majesty's Government. The Ministers have explained it so clearly that no one can be in any doubt. Let us see, then, what that policy is. First, we stand by all our obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations. We will bear our part to the utmost of our ability in any measure which the Council of the League of Nations may prescribe against the declared aggressor in the present war. The Government have, very rightly and very wisely, taken all the necessary precautions to put the British fleets and squadrons in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea in a condition of security during what may be a protracted period of tension. There is no reason to suppose that our historic control of the Mediterranean will be challenged. On the other hand, we have declared that we will not take single-handed action or go farther than the other countries are ready to go. I believe the great mass of the British people are profoundly agreed both upon our policy and its limitations. No one can suggest that his Majesty's Government have not fulfilled every obligation into which they have entered not only in the letter but also in the spirit. Indeed, we have gone beyond our strict obligations. We have taken the lead, and we are taking the lead, in urging the League of Nations to assert its authority in the most effective way; and we have, no doubt, incurred a great deal of odium in Italy in consequence. Whether we ought to have taken the lead as we have done is a matter for argument. It is certainly the course with which the most generous elements in British public life will sympathise. But no one can accuse us of having failed in the slightest degree in our international duty. On the contrary, we have, as usual, been better than our word, and I hope our friends in France will weigh and ponder over that pregnant and far-reaching truth. Having taken our course and made up our minds, there is nothing to do but to carry it out with composure and consistency. It is very
difficult to see far ahead. War has begun between Italy and
Abyssinia. Abyssinia has been invaded. Abyssinian tribesmen are
being attacked by very large Italian armies equipped with all the
most terrible weapons of modern science. They are being bombed
from the air, bombarded by cannon, trampled down by tanks, and
they are fighting as well as they can in their primitive way to defend
their hearths and homes, their rights and freedom.
It would be very rash to predict how the war will go. The accounts
in the newspapers are very full, very interesting, and very obscure. It
does not seem that much has happened so far. We shall be able to
judge better when the Italian invasion has penetrated more deeply
into the heart of this very rugged and difficult country, and when the
Italian line of communication extends to over 150 miles. Until then it
is wiser to suspend judgment on the military problem.
Neither do we know what degree of sanctions the League of
Nations will prescribe against the aggressor. Whatever happens we
shall do our bit. But this is a most painful question for France, and it
is important that we should understand the anxious and cruel nature
of the issue presented to the French people.
They see the Germans arming night and day, spending at least
£700,000,000 or £800,000,000 in borrowed money in a single year
on warlike preparations. They know that Germany has nearly twice
their manpower, and that this enormous martial population is being
organised and equipped at a speed and at a cost never yet equalled in
time of peace. In fact Germany is, at this moment, living and working
under war conditions, except that there is no actual fighting going
on. "
"'Nazidom ... with all its hatreds', 24 October 1935, House of Commons",,"I bear no grudge, I have no prejudice against the German people. I have many German friends, and I have a lively admiration for their splendid qualities of intellect and valour, and for their achievements in science and art. The re-entry into the European circle of a
Germany at peace within itself, with a heart devoid of hate, would be
the most precious benefit for which we could strive, and a supreme
advantage which alone would liberate Europe from its peril and its
fear, and I believe that the British and French democracies, the exservice men, would go a long way in extending the hand of
friendship to realise such a hope.
But that is not the position which exists today. A very different
position exists today. We cannot afford to see Nazidom in its present
phase of cruelty and intolerance, with all its hatreds and all its
gleaming weapons, paramount in Europe at the present time ....
It is quite certain that the British Empire will never fight another
war contrary to the League of Nations. Any attempt to embark upon
a war of aggrandisement, or pride or ambition would break the
British Empire into fragments and any Government that was even
suspected of such a motive would be chased from power long before
its machinations could become effective. Therefore, if ever the British
Empire is called upon to defend itself, its cause and the cause of the
League of Nations will be one. Where, then, is the difference? The
fortunes of the British Empire and its glory are inseparably
interwoven with the fortunes of the world. We rise or we fall
together. Indeed, if we survive today the extraordinary situation it is
because even in bygone times our ancestors so managed that in the
main the special interests of Britain conformed to the general
interests of the world. (Interruption.) Read history and find there
anything which can contradict what I have said. I, therefore, make
no secret of the fact that personally I regard the British Navy and its
sister services and all that is implied in the Covenant of the League of
Nations as allied insurances for our peace and safety, and I am sure
we need them both, and we need, besides, all our wit and wisdom,
and all our patience and common sense in order to escape ourselves
and to help the modern world out of the dangers which encompass
us. What is the great new fact about the League of Nations? What is
the change that has taken place since we separated last August? It is
this. The League of Nations is alive. It is alive and in action. It is
fighting for its life. Probably it is fighting for all our lives. But it is
fighting. No one can ever pretend that without the United States the
League of Nations could be a supreme authority, but the question
has been for a long time whether it was not dead and a sham. People
were despairing of the League of Nations. They pointed, and my
right hon. Friend the Member for Sparkbrook [Mr Amery] still points, with accusing and wounding finger to its powerlessness in the
Far East and to its indifference in the Chaco War. When we
separated in August the League of Nations was becoming a byword.
Look at what has happened since. Here are 50 sovereign States
solemnly sitting down together to devise and concert hostile
economic action against a great Power, prohibiting the export of
arms to Italy, encouraging such export to Italy's enemy, taking
concerted measures to destroy Italian credit and financial strength in
every quarter of the globe, laying an embargo on many kinds of
exports to Italy and even attempting a complete boycott of Italian
imports into each country. When we are told that there are leakages
and loopholes, that difficulties will arise and disputes will break out
between the boycotters and so forth, that may all be true, but these
are, to anyone who views things in their due proportion, only the
exceptions which are proving a most impressive rule. Such a system
of pains and penalties has never been proclaimed against a single
State, as far as I am aware, in the whole history of the world. If we
could get away a little further from the scene and take a more general
view than is possible to us living through events from day to day, I
am sure we should see that we are already in the presence of a
memorable event.
Still more remarkable is the Italian acceptance of these sanctions.
When we separated in August, the story was, when these matters
were viewed in an academic light, that economic sanctions meant
war, and certainly the original attitude of Italy was that any attempt
to apply sanctions would be treated as an unfriendly act and an
affront. But what has happened? All this has proved to be untrue.
Signor Mussolini - I think it is a sign of his commanding mind; to
my mind it is one of the strongest things he has done - has submitted
to these invidious sanctions and still preserved his contact with the
League of Nations. Instead of saying 'Italy will meet them with war,'
he says 'Italy will meet them with discipline, with frugality and with
sacrifice.' That is a great saying in the setting, in the difficulties, in
which he stands. So I say that we are not only in the presence of an
assertion of the public law of Europe but of its recognition by the
State affected and by the historic figure at the head of that State. That
is also a truly remarkable fact, and one that is full of hope.
What does the House suppose has been the underlying cause of the
transformation in the activity and force of the League of Nations
which we have seen operative in the short time that we have been
absent from this House? The right hon. Gentleman the Member for
Darwen [Sir H. Samuel] seemed to be entirely unconscious of it. He seemed to suppose that it is simply the moral force of public opinion
and the many good arguments used by the Liberal party and by
Liberal writers which have produced this transformation. One is
quite sorry to undeceive him. One would like him to have nursed his
delusion for a little longer. But the reason is so apparent that it
cannot be concealed. The reason why the League of Nations is now a
reality and is now gripping all men's minds and inspiring loyalties in
we know not what other countries which have hitherto regarded it as
an academic apparition is because there has been behind it, as there
was behind so many causes vital to human progress and freedom, the
Royal Navy.
How did this arise? Let us see exactly in what context it arose. As I
understand it, when the Government determined to take a strong line
upon the League of Nations Council it was certain that it would
bring us into antagonism with Italy in the Mediterranean. We have
ancient and valuable naval and military establishments in the
Mediterranean. We have a fleet, a vital part of our own main fleet, in
the Mediterranean. No doubt, all these have been allowed to fall into
a very easy peacetime state and the Government would have been
greatly to blame if they had pursued the course on which they had
decided at Geneva without at the same time making our defences safe
in the Mediterranean. So the great machine was set in motion, and
after an interval of a few weeks the impressive effect of superior sea
power became manifest. That power has not been transferred to the
League of Nations. Nevertheless it lies in a certain sense behind it,
and it has invested every decision and every debate at Geneva with a
gravity and a significance which it never otherwise could have
possessed. "
"Germany ... fears no one', March 1936, House of Commons",,"For four hundred years the foreign policy of England has been to oppose the strongest, most aggressive, most dominating Power on the Continent, and particularly to prevent the Low Countries falling into the hands of such a Power. Viewed in the light of history, these four centuries of consistent purpose amid so many changes of names and facts, of circumstances and conditions, must rank as one of the most remarkable episodes which the records of any race, nation, state, or people can show. Moreover, on all occasions England took the more difficult course. Faced by Philip II of Spain, against Louis XIV under William III and Marlborough, against Napoleon, against William II of Germany, it would have been easy and must have been very tempting to join with the stronger and share the fruits of his conquest. However, we always took the harder course, joined with the less strong Power:;, made a combination among them, and thus defeated and frustrated the Continental military tyrant whoever he was, whatever nation he led. Thus we preserved the liberties of Europe, protected the growth of is vivacious and varied society, and emerged after four terrible struggles with an ever-growing fame and widening Empire, and with the Low Countries safely protected in their independence. Here is the wonderful unconscious tradition of British foreign policy. All our thoughts rest in that tradition today. I know of nothing which has occurred to alter or weaken the justice, wisdom, valour, and prudence upon which our ancestors acted. I know of nothing that has happened to human nature which in the slightest degree alters the validity of their conclusions. I know of nothing in military, political, economic, or scientific fact which makes me feel that we might not, or cannot, march along the same road. I venture to put this very general proposition before you because it seems to me that if it is accepted, everything else becomes much more simple. Observe that the policy of England takes no account of which
nation it is that seeks the overlordship of Europe. The question is not
whether it is Spain, or the French Monarchy, or the French Empire,
or the German Empire, or the Hitler regime. It has nothing to do
with rulers or nations; it is concerned solely with whoever is the
strongest or the potentially dominating tyrant. Therefore, we should
not be afraid of being accused of being pro-French or anti-German. If
the circumstances were reversed, we could equally be pro-German and anti-French. It is a law of public policy which we are following,
and not a mere expedient dictated by accidental circumstances, or
likes and dislikes, or any other sentiment.
The question, therefore, arises which is today the Power in Europe
which is the strongest, and which seeks in a dangerous and
oppressive sense to dominate. Today, for this year, probably for part
of 1937, the French Army is the strongest in Europe. But no one is
afraid of France. Everyone knows that France wants to be let alone,
and that with her it: is only a case of self-preservation. Everyone
knows that the French are peaceful and overhung by fear. They are
at once brave, resolute, peace-loving, and weighed down by anxiety.
They are a liberal nation with free parliamentary institutions.
Germany, on the other hand, fears no one. She is arming in a
manner which has never been seen in German history. She is led by a
handful of triumphant desperadoes. The money is running short,
discontents are arising beneath these despotic rulers. Very soon they
will have to choose, on the one hand, between economic and
financial collapse or internal upheaval, and, on the other, a war
which could have no other object, and which, if successful, can have
no other result than a Germanised Europe under Nazi control.
Therefore, it seems to me that all the old conditions present
themselves again, and that our national salvation depends upon our
gathering once again all the forces of Europe to contain, to restrain,
and if necessary to frustrate, German domination. For, believe me, if
any of those other Powers, Spain, Louis XIV, Napoleon, Kaiser
Wilhelm II, had with our aid become the absolute masters of Europe,
they could have despoiled us, reduced us to insignificance and penury
on the morrow of their victory. We ought to set the life and
endurance of the British Empire and the greatness of this island very
high in our duty, and not be led astray by illusions about an ideal
world, which only means that other and worse controls will step into
our place, and that the future direction will belong to them.
It is at this stage that the spacious conception and extremely vital
organisation of the League of Nations presents itself as a prime
factor. The League of Nations is, in a practical sense, a British
conception, and it harmonises perfectly with all our past methods
and actions. Moreover, it harmonises with those broad ideas of right
and wrong, and of peace based upon controlling the major aggressor,
which we have always followed. We wish for the reign of law and
freedom among nations and within nations, and it was for that, and
nothing less than that, that those bygone architects of our repute,
magnitude, and civilisation fought, and won. The dream of a reign of international law and of the settlement of disputes by patient
discussion, but still in accordance with what is lawful and just, is
very dear to the British people. You must not underrate the force
which these ideals exert upon the modern British democracy. One
does not know how these seeds are planted by the winds of the
centuries in the hearts of the working people. They are there, and just
as strong as their love of liberty. We should not neglect them,
because they are the essence of the genius of this island. Therefore,
we believe that in the fostering and fortifying of the League of
Nations will be found the best means of defending our island
security, as well as maintaining grand universal causes with which we
have very often found our own interests in natural accord.
!vIy three main propositions are: First, that we must oppose the
would-be dominator or potential aggressor. Secondly, that Germany
under its present Nazi regime and with its prodigious armaments, so
swiftly developing, fills unmistakably that part. Thirdly, that the
League of Nations rallies many countries, and unites our own people
here at home in the most effective way to control the would-be
aggressor. I venture most respectfully to submit these main themes to
your consideration. Everything else will follow from them.
It is always more easy to discover and proclaim general principles
than to apply them. First, we ought to count our effective association
with France. That doe'S not mean that we should develop a needlessly
hostile mood against Germany. It is a part of our duty and our
interest to keep the temperature low between these two countries. We
shall not have any difficulty in this so far as France is concerned. Like
us, they are a parliamentary democracy with tremendous inhibitions
against war, and, like us, under considerable drawbacks in preparing
their defence. Therefore, I say we ought to regard our defensive
association with France as fundamental. Everything else must be
viewed in proper subordination now that the times have become so
sharp and perilous. Those who are possessed of a definite body of
doctrine and of deeply rooted convictions upon it will be in a much
better position to deal with the shifts and surprises of daily affairs
than those who are merely taking short views, and indulging their
natur"",l impulses as they are evoked by what they read from day to
day. The first thing is to decide where you want to go. For myself, I
am for the armed League of all Nations, or as many as you can get,
against the potential aggressor, with England and France as the core
of it. Let us neglect nothing in our power to establish the great
international framework. If that should prove to be beyond our
strength, or if it breaks down through the weakness or wrongdoing of others, then at least let us make sure that England and France, the
two surviving free great countries of Europe, can together ride out
any storm that may blow with good and reasonable hopes of once
again coming safely into port."
"The Jews: 'Their blood and race', 24 March 1936, House of Commons",,"The right hon. Gentleman has assured us that the Mandate and the Balfour Declaration are safe, but I personally feel great doubts about that. If you have an Arab majority, undoubtedly you will have continued friction between the principle of the Balfour Declaration and the steps that must be taken day by day and month by month to give effect to that Declaration and the wishes of the Arab majority. I should have thought it would be a very great obstruction to the development of Jewish immigration into Palestine and to the development of the national home of the Jews there. I have no hostility for the Arabs. I think I made most of the settlements over 14 years ago governing the Palestine situation. The Emir Abdullah is in Transjordania, where I put him one Sunday afternoon at Jerusalem. I acted upon the advice of that very great man Colonel Lawrence, who was at my side in making the arrangements, which I believe have stood the test of time and many changes of government throughout the Middle East. But I cannot conceive that you will be able to reconcile, at this juncture and at this time, the development of the policy of the Balfour Declaration with an Arab majority on the Legislative Council. I do not feel a bit convinced of it, even though Sir Andrew Walker may be of that opinion. I do not feel convinced when I see so many other people who have studied the matter, and who are friends of Palestine,
friends of the Arabs, friends of the Jews, who view this departure at
the present moment with the very greatest misgiving.
We are doing very fine work in Palestine at the present moment.
When I travelled through the country a little more than a year ago I
was enormously impressed with the order and smoothness with
which the administration was being conducted. If you go into
neighbouring countries, like Syria, you see that there is also order
and progress, but enormous military forces are used. Scores of
thousands of troops are maintained in the country. I always consider
that our administration must be judged, in comparison with these
countries, not by the fact that they can govern with overwhelming
military forces - anyone can do that - but that we can conduct
progressive administration with the comparatively small forces that
we employ in those areas.
Do not be in a hurry to overturn the existing system. It is working
very well. It is not as though it had got into such a state that you said
that you could not go on any more with the present administration,
and that, although yOUl' local government institutions have completely failed up to date, or have made no success of their
experiment, nevertheless you must plunge into the larger field. That
is not the position. You are in the full tide of a successful experiment
in British administration and your local government is moving
forward in a very slow manner. Surely, therefore, you can afford to
wait for some other time. Does the right hon. Gentleman mean to say
that if, under the advice of Parliament or under the persuasion which
reaches him from any quarter, he decided that this matter could not
go forward this year or next year, but that he would wait for some
other time - does he suggest that he would feel himself guilty of a
breach of faith, of a breaking of the pledge given to the League of
Nations? It is absurd. I have not the slightest doubt that, if our
representatives at Geneva explained the position as it has been
explained in this House from every bench, they would get cordial
support for not taking this step at the present moment, from the
authority whom they have a right to consult.
I have been speaking of this matter in connection with Palestine,
but, of course, there is in our minds an added emphasis upon this
question of Jewish migration which comes from other quarters, at a
time when the Jewish race in a great country is being subjected to
most horrible, cold, scientific persecution, brutal persecution, a cold
'pogrom' as it has been called - people reduced from affluence to ruin, and then, even in that posltlOn, denied the opportunity of
earning their daily bread, and cut out even from relief by grants to
tide the destitute through the winter; their little children pilloried in
the schools to which they have to go; their blood and race declared
defiling and accursed; every form of concentrated human wickedness
cast upon these people by overwhelming power, by vile tyranny. I say
that, when that is the case, surely the House of Commons will not
allow the one door which is open, the one door which allows some
relief, some escape from these conditions, to be summarily closed,
nor even allow it to be suggested that it may be obstructed by the
course which we take now. "
"'Great hammers descending day and night', 26 March 1936, House of Commons",,"The violation of the Rhineland is serious from the point of view of
the menace to which it exposes Holland, Belgium and France. It is
also serious from the fact that when it is fortified - and I listened with
apprehension to what the Secretary of State said about the Germans
declining even to refrain from entrenching themselves during the
period of negotiations; I listened with sorrow to that - when there is
there a line of fortifications, as I suppose there will be in a very short
time, it will produce great reactions on the European situation. It will
be a barrier across Germany's front-door, which will leave her free to
sally out eastward and southward by the back door.
In spite of the seriousness which I attach to this reoccupation of
the Rhineland, I must say that it seems to me the smallest part of the
whole problem. What is the real problem, the real peril? It is not the reoccupation of the Rhineland, but this enormous process of the
rearmament of Germany. There is the peril. My right hon. Friend
opposite says that in the election I seemed to be haunted by this idea.
I confess that I have been occupied with this idea of the great wheels
revolving and the great hammers descending day and night in
Germany, making the whole industry of that country an arsenal,
making the whole of that gifted and valiant population into one
great disciplined war machine. There is the problem that lies before
you. There is what is bringing the war. This Rhineland business is
but a step, is but a stage, is but an incident in this process. I agree
very much with the spokesman of the official Labour Opposition
when he said there was fear. There is fear, in every country, all
round. Even here, in this country, with some protection from
distance, there is fear, deep fear. It takes a deep fear to make the hon.
Member for West Fife (Mr Gallacher) speak in terms which
commend themselves to almost everyone who was in the House.
What is the fear and what is the question which arises from that fear?
It is, 'How are we going to stop this war which seems to be moving
towards us in so many ways?'
There are, of course, two practical foreign policies for our country.
The first is an alliance between Great Britain and France, the two
surviving liberal democracies of the West, who, strongly armed, rich,
powerful, with the seas at their disposal, with great air forces and
great armies, would stand with their backs to the ocean and allow
the explosion which may come in Europe to blast its way eastward or
southward. There is <i practical foreign policy, but I do hope that we
shall not resign ourselves to that, without first an earnest effort to
persevere in the other policy, namely, the establishment of real
collective security under the League of Nations and of the reign of
law and respect for international law throughout Europe. I venture
to make a suggestion which I feel will not be entirely repugnant to
those who sit opposite, namely, that, apart from this particular
emergency and apart from the measures which the Foreign Secretary
has taken, we should endeavour now with great resolution to
establish effective collective security. In my view, all the nations and
States that are alarmed at the growth of German armaments ought to
combine for mutual aid, in pacts of mutual assistance, approved by
the League of Nations and in accordance with the Covenant of the
League.
We hear talk of the encirclement of Germany. I thought that the
last speaker quite justly said that war encirclement would be intolerable, but peaceful, defensive encirclement may be inevitable,
before the alarms of the nations are allayed. I say we would impose
no encirclement on Germany that we would not submit to ourselves.
It is not a case of the encirclement of Germany but of the
encirclement of the potential aggressor. If we are the aggressors, let
us be encircled and brought to reason by the pressure of other
countries. If France is the aggressor, let her be restrained in the same
way; and if it be Germany, let Germany take the measures meted out
to her by countries who submit themselves to the law which they are
prepared to take a share in enforcing. The first thing we ought to do
is to make these pacts of mutual aid and assistance. My right hon.
Friend the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs (Mr Lloyd George),
who is not here now, spoke grave words of warning about military
conventions. But you cannot have effective arrangements for mutual
aid in contingencies of peril unless you have conventions. That is the
first thing.
In the second place, I agree with what was said by the right hon.
Gentleman who opened the Debate for the Opposition, that the
Powers, once they are woven into this strong confederacy for defence
and peace, should give to Germany an absolute guarantee of the
inviolability of German soil and a promise that, if anyone invades
her, all will turn against the offender and if she strikes at anyone, all
will stand by and defend the victim. I am looking for peace. I am
looking for a way to stop war, but you will not stop it by pious
sentiments and appeals. You will only stop it by making practical
arrangements. When you have these two conditions established
firmly, when you have linked up the forces at the disposal of the
League for defence, and when you have given that guarantee to
Germany, then is the first moment when you should address
Germany collectively, not only upon the minor question of the Rhine
but upon the supreme question of German rearmament in relation to
other countries - and they must not shirk presenting themselves to
that test also. Further, at that moment you must invite Germany to
state her grievances, to lay them on the council board and to let us
have it out. But do not let us have it out as if we were a rabble flying
before forces we dare not resist. Let us have it out on the basis that
we are negotiating from strength and not from weakness; that we are
negotiating from unity and not from division and isolation; that we
are seeking to do justice, because we have power.
The whole history of the world is summed up in the fact that when
nations are strong they are not always just, and when they wish to be just they are often no longer strong. I desire to see the collective
forces of the world invested with overwhelming power. If you are
going to run this thing on a narrow margin and to depend on a very
slight margin, one way or the other, you are going to have war. But if
you get five or ten to one on one side, all bound rigorously by the
Covenant and the conventions which they own, then, in my opinion,
you have an opportunity of making a settlement which will heal the
wounds of the world. Let us have this blessed union of power and of

"'Hitler has torn up the treaties', 6 April 1936, House of Commons",,"Herr Hitler has torn up treaties and has garrisoned the Rhineland. His troops are there, and there they are going to stay. All this means that the Nazi regime has gained a new prestige in Germany and in all the neighbouring countries. But more than that. Germany is now fortifying the Rhine zone, or is about to fortify it. No doubt it will take some time. We are told that in the first instance only field entrenchments will be erected, but those who know to what perfection the Germans can carry field entrenchments like the Hindenburg Line, with all the masses of concrete and the underground chambers there included - those who remember that will realise that field entrenchments differ only in degree from permanent fortifications, and work steadily up from the first cutting of the sods to their final and perfect form. I do not doubt that the whole of the German frontier opposite to France is to be fortified as strongly and as speedily as possible. Three, four or ~ix months will certainly see a barrier of enormous strength. What will be the diplomatic and strategic consequences of that? I am not dealing with the technical aspect, but with the diplomatic reactions. The creation of a line of forts opposite to the French frontier will enable the German troops to be economised on that line, and will enable the main forces to swing round through Belgium and Holland. That is for us a danger of the most serious kind. Suppose we broke with France. Suppose these efforts to divide the last surviving free democracies of the Western world were successful and they were sundered, and suppose that France, isolated, could do no more than defend her own frontier behind Belgium and Holland by prolonging her fortress line, those small countries might very speedily pass under German domination, and the large colonial empires which they possess would no doubt be transferred at the same time. These are matters that ought not to escape our attention. I thought that the Prime Minister's remark which he made some years ago about our frontier being the Rhine [30 July 1934] was liable at the time to be misunderstood; but if he meant that it was a mortal danger to Britain to have the Low Countries in the fortified grip of the strongest military power upon the Continent, and now, in these days, to have all the German aviation bases established there, he was only repeating the lesson taught in four centuries of history. That danger will be brought definitely and sensibly nearer from the moment that this new line of German fortifications is completed. But then, look East. There the consequences of the Rhineland fortification may be more immediate. That is to us a less direct danger, but is a more imminent danger. The moment those fortifications are completed, and in proportion as they are completed, the whole aspect of Middle Europe is changed. The Baltic States, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, with which must be associated Yugoslavia, Rumania, Austria and some other countries, are all affected very decisively the moment that this great work of construction has been completed. Some of those nations, but not all, are now balancing in deep perplexity what course they should take. Should they continue in their association with the League of Nations and with what is called collective security and the reign of law? Or should they make the best terms they can with the one resolute, warlike Power which is stirring in Europe at the present time? That is the question they have to ask themselves. If nothing satisfactory has been achieved by the negotiations and conferences which no doubt will occupy a large part of this
year, we may see many powerful nations, with armies and air forces,
associated with the German Nazi system, and the other nations who
are opposed to that system isolated and practically helpless. It is idle
to say that these are not matters which the House of Commons
should view with vigilance and attention. It is idle to pretend that
these are only matters affecting the obscurities, the politics and the
hatreds of Central Europe. "
"Thank God for the French Army', 24 September 1936,Paris",,"There are three kinds of nations in the world at the present time.
There are the nations which are governed by the Nazis; there are the
nations which are governed by the Bolshevists, and there are the
nations which govern themselves. It is this third class of nations in
which the French and English peoples are most interested. We are
interested in the nations which govern themselves through Parliaments freely elected under a democratic franchise. These are the
nations where the people have the right to criticise the Ministers and
functionaries of State. They can choose the complexion of the
Government they wish to manage their affairs. They can hold public
meetings to express all their different opinions. The individual citizen
has the right if aggrieved to sue the State at law, and impartial Courts
are provided which pronounce whether he or the executive power is
in the right. In these countries the State exists to protect the rights of
the individual, to enable him to make the best of himself, and to
secure the free development of family life within the cottage home.
We live in countries where the people own the Government and not
in countries where the Government owns the people. Thought is free; speech is free; religion is free; no one can say that the Press is not free;
in short, we live in a liberal society, the direct product of the great
advances in human dignity, stature, and well-being which will ever
be the glory of the nineteenth century.
We have also the feeling that in France, England, the United States,
in Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, and Scandinavia we not only have
liberal constitutions which secure our rights, but we have been able
to produce a greater material prosperity more widely diffused among
the masses of the people than any form of despotism has yet been
able to show. In these self-governing countries we may also claim to
lead the world alike in accumulated wealth and in compassionate
treatment of misfortune.
We must recognise that we have a great treasure to guard; that the
inheritance in our possession represents the prolonged achievement
of the centuries; that there is not one of our simple uncounted rights
today for which better men than we are have not died on the scaffold
or the battlefield. We have not only a great treasure; we have a great
cause. Are we taking every measure within our power to defend that
cause?
I am sure that the French, British, or American democracies would
be very miserable if they were suddenly put under Nazi or Bolshevist
rule. France and England are the chief architects of modern
civilisation, and the United States is the heir and champion of our
ideas. How could we bear, nursed as we have been in a free
atmosphere, to be gagged and muzzled; to have spies, eavesdroppers,
and delators at every corner; to have even private conversation
caught up and used against us by the secret police and all their agents
and creatures; to be arrested and interned without trial; or to be tried
by political or party courts for crimes hitherto unknown to civil law?
How could we bear to be treated like schoolboys when we are
grown-up men; to be turned out on parade by tens of thousands to
march and cheer for this slogan or for that; to see philosophers,
teachers, and authors bullied and toiled to death in concentration
camps; to be forced every hour to conceal the natural normal
workings of the human intellect and the pulsations of the human
heart? Rather than submit to such oppression there is no length we
would not go. Our cause is good. Our rights are good. Let us make
sure that our arms are good. Let us make sure that our conduct is
wise. Let us make sure that it is governed by forethought and
statesmanship.
The French Republic and the British Empire should stand shoulder
to shoulder against aggression. After all we are not so weak and helpless as some people make out. Four years ago when things were
very different I exclaimed to the House of Commons, 'Thank God
for the French Army.' I repeat it here today with the instructed
conviction that that Army is today the finest in the world. The future
is not so certain - there are grave anxieties about the future - but it is
something to speak with confidence of today. Of the British Fleet I
can speak with particular assurance. It is certainly far stronger in
relation to any fleet or combination of fleets in Europe than it was in
1914, and by the arrangemeats which are now being made by his
Majesty's Government its preponderance will certainly be maintained in the future. There remains the problem of the Air, which
requires the most urgent study of the Western democracies and
greater exertions than either of them has yet made. But at any rate it
would be a great mistake to suppose that we are either of us
defenceless in this new arm at the present time. Here at any rate are
means of defence which leave us still masters of our fortunes.
But good defences alone would never enable us by themselves to
survive in the modern grim gigantic world. There must be added to
those defences the sovereign power of generous motives and of high
ideals, in fact, that cause of freedom, moral and intellectual, which I
have endeavoured to describe. We must trust something to the power
of enlightened ideas. We must trust much to our resolve not to be
impatient or quarrelsome or arrogant. We seek peace. We long for
peace. We pray for peace. We seek no territory. We aim at no
invidious monopoly of raw materials. Our hearts are clean. We have
no old scores to repay. We submit ourselves whole-heartedly, nay
proudly, to the Covenant of the League of Nations. We desire
faithfully and fairly to bear our part in building up a true collective
security which shall not only lighten the burden of the toiling
millions, but also provide the means by which the grievances of great
dissatisfied nations, if well-founded, can be peacefully adjusted.
Another Great War would extinguish what is left of the civilisation
of the world, and the glory of Europe would sink for uncounted
generations into the dark abyss. We wish to prevent this war. We can
only do so if we are armed and strong, if we are united upon
fundamental principles, if we serve with equal loyalty side by side for
the same high purpose, for no selfish purpose, no narrowly national
purpose, no reactionary purpose, but a purpose known to us all,
comprehended by us all, a purpose worthy of the genius of mankind.
It is the nature of extremists to be violent and furious, whereas the
great central mass of temperate, tolerant, good-natured humanity is
apt to be feeble in action and leadership. But if the cause of ordered freedom, of representative government, of the rights of the individual
against the State is worth defending, it is surely worth defending
efficiently. If we are to be drawn into such a competition let us make
sure we win. Let us make sure that the force of right is not in the last
resort deprived of the right of force. In Britain as in France the great
mass of good people mean the right thing. Let those who have the
responsibility of leadership make sure that they get it.
When we speak of representative or Parliamentary government we
mean a system which faithfully and punctually gives those guarantees
of law and order, or justice, tolerance, and fair play without which
no Parliament or parley is possible. A Parliamentary regime must not
become a mere fraudulent pretence to cover the advances of Nazi-ism
or Communism. It was a grave fault in the Spanish Ministers that
they continued to accept responsibility after they had ceased to have
power. Their names stood for Parliamentary government; but others
were acting in their names. That is a betrayal of trust. And this
feature has justified, nay imposed upon us, a strict neutrality.
When we speak of collective security we mean a real collective
security. We do not mean merely that one or two Powers should run
great risks while others fail to play their part according to their
strength; we certainly do not mean a multiplication of risks for some
without equal or even any compensating protection. We do not mean
that the peace-seeking narions should disarm while those who glorify
war forge their weapons and array their regiments. Secondly, when
we seek this real collective security for ourselves we offer it most
earnestly to all others. Great Britain and France ask for themselves
no single guarantee of safety and independence that they are not
willing and resolute to extend to the great German people, with
whom we all sincerely desire to dwell in peace and goodwill.
Someone asked me: 'If Germany and Russia went to war, would
you be in favour of Germany or of Russia?' That is a very easy
question to answer. Our feelings and any action we are bound to
take under the Covenant of the League of Nations would be against
the unprovoked aggressor. It would not be a question of Germany or
Russia. It would not be a question of Right or Left. It would be a
question of right or wrong. I should like to see, and there are many in
Britain who think with me, so tremendous an organisation of nations
ready to fall upon the aggressor that no one would dare to break the
peace of Europe. If Governments are to band themselves together for
collective security, it follows that they must rigorously abstain from
organised interference in the internal affairs of their neighbours and
fellow members in the League. When we speak of aggression we mean unprovoked aggression. Propaganda carried on by foreign
money in any country is a serious form of provocation. "
"Lawrence of Arabia, 3 October 1936, Oxford",,"Although more than a year has passed since Lawrence was taken from us, the impression of his personality remains living and vivid upon the minds of his friends, and the sense of his loss is in no way dimmed among his countrymen. All feel the poorer that he has gone from us. In these days dangers and difficulties gather upon Britain and her Empire, and we are also conscious of a lack of outstanding figures with which to overcome them. Here was a man in whom there existed not only an immense capacity for service, but that touch of genius which everyone recognises and no one can define. Whether in his great period of adventure and command or in these later years of self-suppression and self-imposed eclipse, he always reigned over those with whom he came in contact. They felt themselves in the presence of an extraordinary being. They felt that his latent reserves of force and will power were beyond measurement. If he roused himself to action, who should say what crisis he could not surmount or quell? If things were going very badly, how glad one would be to see him come round the corner. Part of the secret of this stimulating ascendancy lay of course in his disdain for most of the prizes, the pleasures and comforts of life. The world naturally looks with some awe upon a man who appears unconcernedly indifferent to horne, money, comfort, rank, or even power and fame. The world feels not without a certain apprehension that here is someone outside its jurisdiction; someone before whom its allurements may be spread in vain; someone strangely enfranchised, untamed, untrammelled by convention, moving independently of the ordinary currents of human action; a being readily
capable of violent revolt or supreme sacrifice; a man, solitary,
austere, to whom existence is no more than a duty, yet a duty to be
faithfully discharged. He was indeed a dweller upon the mountain
tops where the air is cold, crisp, and rarefied, and where the view on
clear days commands all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of
them.
Lawrence was one of those beings whose pace of life was faster
and more intense than what is normal. Just as an aeroplane only flies
by its speed and pressure against the air, so he flew best and easiest in
the hurricane. He was not in complete harmony with the normal.
The fury of the Great War raised the pitch of life to the Lawrence
standard. The multitudes were swept forward till their pace was the
same as his. In this heroic period he found himself in perfect relation
both to men and events.
I have often wondered what would have happened to Lawrence if
the Great War had continued for several more years. His fame was
spreading fast and with the momentum of the fabulous throughout
Asia. The earth trembled with the wrath of the warring nations. All
the metals were molten. Everything was in motion. No one could say
what was impossible. Lawrence might have realised Napoleon's
young dream of conquering the East; he might have arrived at
Constantinople in 1919 or 1920 with most of the tribes and races of
Asia Minor and Arabia at his back. But the storm wind ceased as
suddenly as it had arisen. The skies were clear; the bells of Armistice
rang out. Mankind returned with indescribable relief to its long
interrupted, fondly-cherished ordinary life, and Lawrence was left
once more moving alone on a different plane and at a different speed.
In this we find an explanation of the last phase of his all too brief
life. It is not the only explanation. The sufferings and stresses he had
undergone, both physical and psychic, during the war had left their
scars and injuries upon him. These were aggravated by the distress
which he felt at which he deemed the ill-usage of his Arab friends and
allies to whom he had pledged the word of Britain, and the word of
Lawrence. He was capable of suffering mental pain in an exceptional
degree. I am sure that the ordeal of watching the helplessness of his
Arab friends in the grand confusions of the Peace Conference was the
main cause which decided his renunciation of all power, and so far as
possible of all interest in great public affairs.
In this premature retirement he had to lay hold of detailed tasks wherewith to fill the days and the hours. The writing of his book The
Seven Pillars was a powerful solace to him. To all of us it is one of
the treasures of English literature. The Seven Pillars as a narrative of
war and adventure, as a portrayal of all that the Arabs mean in the
world, is unsurpassed. It ranks with the greatest books ever written
in the English language. It is not, I think, excessive to class it in
interest and charm with Pilgrim's Progress, Robinson Crusoe, and
Gulliver's Travels. If Lawrence had never done anything except write
this book as a mere work of the imagination his fame would last, in
Macaulay's familiar phrase, 'as long as the English language is
spoken in any quarter of the globe.' But this was a book of fact, not
fiction, and the author was also the commander. When most of the
vast literature of the Great War has been sifted and superseded by the
epitomes, commentaries, and histories of future generations, when
the complicated and infinitely costly operations of ponderous armies
are the concern only of the military student, when our struggles are
viewed in a fading perspective and in truer proportion, Lawrence's
tale of the revolt in the desert will gleam with immortal fire.
When this literary masterpiece was written, lost, and written again;
when every illustration had been profoundly considered and every
incident of typography and paragraphing settled with meticulous
care; when Lawrence on his bicycle had carried the precious volumes
to the few - the very few - he deemed worthy to read them, happily
he found another task to his hands which cheered and comforted his
soul. He saw as clearly as anyone the vision of air power and all that
it would mean in traffic and war. He found in the life of an
aircraftman that balm of peace and equipoise which no great station
or command could have bestowed upon him. He felt that in living
the life of a private in the Royal Air Force he would dignify that
honourable calling and help to attract all that is keenest in our
youthful manhood to the sphere where it is most urgently needed.
For this service and example, to which he devoted the last 12 years of
his life, we owe him a separate debt. It was in itself a princely gift.
If on this occasion I have seemed to dwell upon Lawrence's
sorrows and heart-searchings rather than upon his achievements and
prowess, it is because the latter are so justly famous. He had a full
measure of the versatility of genius. He held one of those master keys
which unlock the doors of many kinds of treasure-houses. He was a
savant as well as a soldier. He was an archaeologist as well as a man
of action. He was an accomplished scholar as well as an Arab
partisan. He was a mechanic as well as a philosopher. His
background of sombre experience and reflection only seemed to set forth more brightly the charm and gaiety of his companionship, and
the generous majesty of his nature. Those who knew him best miss
him most; but our country misses him most of all; and misses him
most of all now. For this is a time when the great problems upon
which his thought and work had so long centred, problems of aerial
defence, problems of our reb.tions with the Arab people, fill an ever
larger space in our affairs. For all his reiterated renunciations I
always felt that he was a man who held himself ready for a Call.
While Lawrence lived one always felt - I certainly felt it strongly -
that some overpowering need would draw him from the modest path
he chose to tread, and set him once again in full action at the centre
of memorable events. It was not to be. The summons which reached
him, and for which he was equally prepared, was of a different order.
It came as he would ha ve wished it, swift and sudden on the wings of
Speed. He had reached the last leap in his gallant course through life. All is over! Fleet career.
Dash of greyhound slipping thongs,
Flight of hlcon, bound of deer,
Mad hoof-thunder in our rear,
Cold air rushing up our lungs,
Din of many tongues. King George the Fifth wrote to Lawrence's brother 'His name will
live in history.' Can we doubt that that is true? It will live in English
letters; it will live in the traditions of the Royal Air Force; it will live
in the annals of war and in the legend of Arabia. It will also live here
in his old school, forever proclaimed and honoured by the monument we have today unveiled. "
"'The locust years', 12 November 1936, House of Commons",,"I have, with some friends, put an Amendment on the Paper .... It is the same as the Amendment which I submitted two years ago, and I have put it in exactly the same terms because I thought it would be a good thing to remind the House of what has happened in these two years. Our Amendment in November 1934 was the culmination of a long series of efforts by private Members and by the Conservative party in the country to warn His Majesty's Government of the dangers to Europe and to this country which were coming upon us through the vast process of German rearmament then already in full swing. The speech which I made on that occasion was much censured as being alarmist by leading Conservative newspapers, and I remember that Mr Lloyd George congratulated the Prime Minister, who was then Lord President, on having so satisfactorily demolished my extravagant fears. What would have been said, I wonder, if I could two years ago have forecast to the House the actual course of events? Suppose we had then been told that Germany would spend for two years £800,000,000 a ye~r upon warlike preparations; that her industries would be organised for war, as the industries of no country have ever been; that by breaking all Treaty engagements she would create a gigantic air force and an army based on universal compulsory service, which by the present time, in 1936, amounts to upwards of thirty-nine divisions of highly equipped troops, including mechanised divisions of almost unmeasured strength, and that behind all this there lay millions of armed and trained men, for whom the formations and equipment are rapidly being prepared to form another eighty divisions in addition to those already perfected. Suppose we had then known that by now two years of compulsory military service would be the rule, with a preliminary year of training in labour camps; that the Rhineland would be occupied by powerful forces and fortified with great skill, and that Germany would be building with our approval, signified by treaty, a large submarine fleet. Suppose we had also been able to foresee the degeneration of the foreign situation, our quarrel with Italy, the Italo-German association, the Belgian declaration about neutrality - which, if the worst interpretation of it proves to be true, so greatly affects the security of this country - and the disarray of the smaller Powers of Central Europe. Suppose all that had been forecast - why, no one would have believed in the truth of such a nightmare tale. Yet just t\vo years have gone by and we see it all in broad daylight. Where shall we be this time in two years? I hesitate now to predict. Let me say, however, that I will not accept the mood of panic or of
despair. There is another side - a side which deserves our study, and
can be studied without derogating in any way from the urgency
which ought to animate OLlr military preparations. The British Navy
is, and will continue to be, for a good many months to come, at least
equal in numbers and superior in maturity to the German Army. The
British and French air forces together are a very different proposition
from either of those forces considered separately. While no one can
prophesy, it seems to me that the Western democracies, provided
they are knit closely together, would be tolerably safe for a
considerable number of months ahead. No one can say to a month or
two, or even a quarter or two, how long this period of comparative
equipoise will last. But it seems certain that during the year 1937 the
German Army will bt!come more numerous than the French Army,
and very much more efficient than it is now. It seems certain that the
German air force will continue to improve upon the long lead which
it already has over us, particularly in respect of long-distance
bombing machines. The year 1937 will certainly be marked by a
great increase in the adverse factors which only intense efforts on our
part can, to any effective extent, countervail.
The efforts of rearmament which France and Britain are making
will not by themselves be sufficient. It will be necessary for the
Western democracies, even at some extension of their risks, to gather
round them all the elements of collective security or of combined
defensive strength against aggression - if you prefer, as I do myself,
to call it so - which can be assembled on the basis of the Covenant of
the League of Nations. Thus I hope we may succeed in again
achieving a position of superior force, and then will be the time, not
to repeat the folly which we committed when we were all-powerful
and supreme, but to invite Germany to make common cause with us
in assuaging the griefs of Europe and opening a new door to peace
and disarmament.
I now turn more directly to the issues of this Debate [on the
Address]. Let us examine our own position. No one can refuse his
sympathy to the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence [Sir
Thomas Inskip]. From time to time my right hon. Friend lets fall
phrases or facts which show that he realises, more than anyone else
on that bench it seems to me, the danger in which we stand. One
such phrase came from his lips the other night. He spoke of 'the years
that the locust hath eaten.' Let us see which are these 'years that the
locust hath eaten,' even if we do not pry too closely in search of the
locusts who have eaten these precious years. For this purpose we must look into the past. From the year 1932, certainly from the
beginning of 1933, when Herr Hitler came into power, it was general
public knowledge in this country that serious rearmament had begun
in Germany. There was a change in the situation. Three years ago, at
the Conservative Conference at Birmingham, that vigorous and
faithful servant of this country, Lord Lloyd, moved the following
resolution:
That this Conference desires to record its grave anxiety in regard to
the inadequacy of the provisions made for Imperial Defence.
That was three years ago, and I see, from The Times report of that
occasion, that I said:
During the last four or five years the world had grown gravely darker.
... We have steadily disarmed, partly with a sincere desire to give a
lead to other countries, and partly through the severe financial
pressure of the time. But a change must now be made. We must not
continue longer on a course in which we alone are growing weaker
while every other natio::! is growing stronger.
The resolution was passed unanimously, with only a rider informing
the Chancellor of the Exchequer that all necessary burdens of
taxation would be cheerfully borne. There were no locusts there, at
any rate.
I am very glad to see the Prime Minister [Mr Baldwin] restored to
his vigour, and to learn that he has been recuperated by his rest and
also, as we hear, rejuvenated. It has been my fortune to have ups and
downs in my political relations with him, the downs on the whole
predominating perhaps, but at any rate we have always preserved
agreeable personal relations, which, so far as I am concerned, are
greatly valued. I am sure he would not wish in his conduct of public
affairs that there should be any shrinking from putting the real issues
of criticism which arise, and I shall certainly proceed in that sense.
My right hon. Friend has had all the power for a good many years,
and therefore there rests upon him inevitably the main responsibility
for everything that has been done, or not done, and also the
responsibility for what is to be done or not done now. So far as the
air is concerned, this responsibility was assumed by him in a very
direct personal manner even before he became Prime Minister. I must
recall the words which he used in the Debate on 8th March, 1934,
nearly three years ago. In answer to an appeal which I made to him,
both publicly and privately, he said: Any Government of this country - a National Government more than
any, and this Government - will see to it that in air strength and air
power this country shall no longer be in a position inferior to any
country within striking distance of our shores.
Well, Sir, I accepted that solemn promise, but some of my friends,
like Sir Edward Grigg and Captain Guest, wanted what the Minister
for the Co-ordination of Defence, in another state of being, would
have called 'further and better particulars', and they raised a debate
after dinner, when the Prime Minister, then Lord President, came
down to the House and really showed less than his usual urbanity in
chiding those Members for even venturing to doubt the intention of
the Government to make good in every respect the pledge which he
had so solemnly gi,ren in the afternoon. I do not think that
responsibility was ever more directly assumed in a more personal
manner. The Prime Minister was not successful in discharging that
task, and he admitted with manly candour a year later that he had
been led into error apon the important question of the relative
strength of the British and German air power.
No doubt as a whole His Majesty's Government were very slow in
accepting the unwelcome fact of German rearmament. They still
clung to the policy of one-sided disarmament. It was one of those
experiments, we are told, which had to be, to use a vulgarism, 'tried
out', just as the experiments of non-military sanctions against Italy
had to be tried out. Both experiments have now been tried out, and
Ministers are accustomed to plume themselves upon the very clear
results of those experiments. They are held to prove conclusively that
the policies subjected to the experiments were all wrong, utterly
foolish, and should never be used again, and the very same men who
were foremost in urging those experiments are now foremost in
proclaiming and denouncing the fallacies upon which they were
based. They have bought their knowledge, they have bought it dear,
they have bought it at our expense, but at any rate let us be duly
thankful that they now at last possess it.
In July 1935, before the General Election, there was a very strong
movement in this House in favour of the appointment of a Minister
to concert the action of the three fighting Services. Moreover, at that
time the Departments of State were all engaged in drawing up the
large schemes of rearmament in all branches which have been laid
before us in the White Paper and upon which we are now engaged.
One would have thought that that was the time when this new
Minister or Co-ordinator was most necessary. He was not, however, in fact appointed until nearly nine months later, in March 1936. No
explanation has yet been given to us why these nine months were
wasted before the taking of what is now an admittedly necessary
measure. The Prime Minister dilated the other night, no doubt very
properly, on the great advantages which had flowed from the
appointment of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence. Every
argument used to show how useful has been the work which he has
done accuses the failure to appoint him nine months earlier, when
inestimable benefits would have accrued to us by the saving of this
long period.
When at last, in March, after all the delays, the Prime Minister
eventually made the appointment, the arrangement of duties was so
ill-conceived that no man could possibly discharge them with
efficiency or even make a speech about them without embarrassment.
I have repeatedly pointed cut the obvious mistake in organisation of
jumbling together - and practically everyone in the House is agreed
upon this - the functions of defence with those of a Minister of
Supply. The proper mganisation, let me repeat, is four Departments
- the Navy, the Army, the Air Force and the Ministry of Supply, with
the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence over the four,
exercising a general supervision, concerting their actions, and
assigning the high priorities of manufacture in relation to some
comprehensive strategic conception. The House is familiar with the
many requests and arguments which have been made to the
Government to create a Ministry of Supply. These arguments have
received powerful reinforcement from another angle in the report of
the Royal Commission on Arms Manufacture.
The first work of this new Parliament, and the first work of the
Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence if he had known as much
about the subject when he was appointed as he does now, would
have been to set up a Ministry of Supply which should, step by step,
have taken over the whole business of the design and manufacture of
all the supplies needed by the Air Force and the Army, and
everything needed for the Navy, except warships, heavy ordnance,
torpedoes and one or two ancillaries. All the rest of the industries of
Britain should have been surveyed from a general integral standpoint, and all existing resources utilised so far as was necessary to
execute the programme.
The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence has argued as usual
against a Ministry of Supply. The arguments which he used were
weighty, and even ponderous - it would disturb and delay existing
programmes; it would 00 more harm than good; it would upset the life and industry of the country; it would destroy the export trade
and demoralise finance at the moment when it was most needed; it
would turn this country into one vast munitions camp. Certainly
these are massive arguments, if they are true. One would have
thought that they would carry conviction to any man who accepted
them. But then my right hon. Friend went on somewhat surprisingly
to say, 'The decision is not final.' It would be reviewed again in a few
weeks. What will you know in a few weeks about this matter that
you do not know now, that you ought not to have known a year ago,
and have not been told any time in the last six months? What is
going to happen in the next few weeks which will invalidate all these
magnificent arguments by which you have been overwhelmed, and
suddenly make it worth your while to paralyse the export trade, to
destroy the finances, and to turn the country into a great munitions
camp?
The First Lord of the Admiralty [Sir Samuel Hoare] in his speech
the other night went even farther. He said, 'We are always reviewing
the position.' Everything, he assured us, is entirely fluid. I am sure
that that is true. Anyone can see what the position is. The
Government simply cannot make up their minds, or they cannot get
the Prime Minister to make up his mind. So they go on in strange
paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute,
adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent. So
we go on preparing more months and years - precious, perhaps vital
to the greatness of Britain - for the locusts to eat. They will say to
me, 'A Minister of Supply is not necessary, for all is going well.' I
deny it. 'The position is satisfactory.' It is not true. 'All is proceeding
according to plan.' We know what that means.
Let me come to the Territorial Army. In March of this year I
stigmatised a sentence in the War Office Memorandum about the
Territorial Army, in which it was said the equipment of the
Territorials could not be undertaken until that of the Regular Army
had been completed. What has been done about all that? It is certain
the evils are not yet removed. I agree wholeheartedly with all that
was said by Lord Winterton the other day about the Army and the
Territorial Force. When I think how these young men who join the
Territorials come forward, almost alone in the population, and take
on a liability to serve anywhere in any part of the world, not even
with a guarantee to serve in their own units; come forward in spite of
every conceivable deterrent; come forward - 140,000 of them,
although they are still not up to strength - and then find that the
Government does not take their effort seriously enough even to equip and arm them properly, I marvel at their patriotism. It is a marvel, it
is also a glory, but a glory we have no right to profit by unless we can
secure proper and efficient equipment for them.
A friend of mine the orher day saw a number of persons engaged in
peculiar evolutions, genuflections and gestures in the neighbourhood
of London. His curiosity was excited. He wondered whether it was
some novel form of gymnastics, or a new religion - there are new
religions which are very popular in some countries nowadays - or
whether they were a party of lunatics out for an airing. On
approaching closer he learned that they were a Searchlight Company
of London Territorials who were doing their exercises as well as they
could without having the searchlights. Yet we are told there is no
need for a Ministry of Supply.
In the manoeuvres of the Regular Army many of the most
important new weapons have to be represented by flags and discs.
When we remember how small our land forces are - altogether only
a few hundred thousand men - it seems incredible that the very
flexible industry of Britain, if properly handled, could not supply
them with their modest requirements. In Italy, whose industry is so
much smaller, whose wealth and credit are a small fraction of this
country's, a Dictator is able to boast that he has bayonets and
equipment for 8,000,000 men. Halve the figure, if you like, and the
moral remains equally cogent.
The Army lacks almost every weapon which is required for the
latest form of modern war. Where are the anti-tank guns, where are
the short-distance wireless sets, where are the field anti-aircraft guns
against low-flying armoured aeroplanes? We want to know how it is
that this country, with its enormous motoring and motor-bicycling
public, is not able to have strong mechanised divisions, both Regular
and Territorial. Surely, when so much of the interest and the taste of
our youth is moving in those mechanical channels, and when the
horse is receding with the days of chivalry into the past, it ought to
be possible to create an army of the size we want fully up to strength
and mechanised to the highest degree.
Look at the Tank Corps. The tank was a British invention. This
idea, which has revolutionised the conditions of modern war, was a
British idea forced on the War Office by outsiders. Let me say they
would have just as hard work today to force a new idea on it. I speak
from what I know. During the war we had almost a monopoly, let
alone the leadership, in tank warfare, and for several years
afterwards we held the foremost place. To England all eyes were
turned. All that has gone now. Nothing has been done in 'the years that the locust hath eaten' to equip the Tank Corps with new
machines. The medium tank which they possess, which in its day was
the best in the world, is now long obsolete. Not only in number - for
there we have never tried to compete with other countries - but in
quality these British weapons are now surpassed by those of
Germany, Russia, Italy and the United States. All the shell plants and
gun plants in the Army, apart from the very small peace-time
services, are in an elementary stage. A very long period must
intervene before any effectual flow of munitions can be expected,
even for the small forces of which we dispose. Still we are told there
is no necessity for a Ministry of Supply, no emergency which should
induce us to impinge on the normal course of trade. If we go on like
this, and I do not see what power can prevent us from going on like
this, some day there may be a terrible reckoning, and those who take
the responsibility so entirely upon themselves are either of a hardy
disposition or they are incapable of foreseeing the possibilities which
mayanse.
Now I come to th~ greatest matter of all, the air. We received on
Tuesday night, from the First Lord of the Admiralty [Sir Samuel
Hoare], the assurance that there is no foundation whatever for the
statement that we are 'vastly behindhand' with our Air Force
programme. It is clear from his words that we are behindhand. The
only question is, what meaning does the First Lord attach to the
word 'vastly'? He also used the expression, about the progress of air
expansion, that it was 'not unsatisfactory'. One does not know what
his standard is. His standards change from time to time. In that
speech of the 11th of September about the League of Nations there
was one standard, and in the Hoare-Laval Pact there was clearly
another.
In August last some of us went in a deputation to the Prime
Minister in order to express the anxieties which we felt about
national defence, and to make a number of statements which we
preferred not to be forced to make in public. I personally made a
statement on the state of the Air Force, to the preparation of which I
had devoted several weeks and which, I am sorry to say, took an
hour to read. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister listened with
his customary exemplary patience. I think I told him beforehand that
he is a good listener, and perhaps he will retort that he learned to be
when I was his colleague. At any rate, he listened with patience, and
that is always something. During the three months that have passed
since then I have checked those facts again in the light of current
events and later knowledge, and were it not that foreign ears listen to all that is said here, or if we were in secret Session, I would repeat my
statement here. And even if only one half were true I am sure the
House would consider that a very grave state of emergency existed,
and also, I regret to say, a state of things from which a certain
suspicion of mismanagement cannot be excluded. I am not going into
any of those details. I make it a rule, as far as I possibly can, to say
nothing in this House upon matters which I am not sure are already
known to the General Staffs of foreign countries; but there is one
statement of very great importance which the Minister for the Coordination of Defence made in his speech on Tuesday [10 Nov.
1936]. He said:
The process of building up squadrons and forming new training units
and skeleton squadrons is familiar to everybody connected with the
Air Force. The number of squadrons in present circumstances at home
today is eighty, and that figure includes sixteen auxiliary squadrons,
but excludes the Fleet Air Arm, and, of course, does not include the
squadrons abroad.
From that figure, and the reservations by which it was prefaced, it is
possible for the House, and also for foreign countries, to deduce
pretty accurately the progress of our Air Force expansion. I feel,
therefore, at liberty to comment on it.
Parliament was promised a total of seventy-one new squadrons,
making a total of 124 squadrons in the horne defence force, by 31
March 1937. This was thought to be the minimum compatible with
our safety. At the end of the last financial year our strength was fiftythree squadrons, including auxiliary squadrons. Therefore, in the
thirty-two weeks which have passed since the financial year began we
have added twenty-eight squadrons - that is to say, less than one new
squadron each week. In order to make the progress which Parliament
was promised, in order to maintain the programme which was put
forward as the minimum, we shall have to add forty-three squadrons
in the remaining twenty weeks, or over two squadrons a week. The
rate at which new squadrons will have to be formed from now till the
end of March will have to be nearly three times as fast as hitherto. I
do not propose to analyse the composition of the eighty squadrons
we now have, but the Minister, in his speech, used a suggestive
expression, 'skeleton squadrons' - applying at least to a portion of
them - but even if everyone of the eighty squadrons had an average
strength of twelve aeroplanes, each fitted with war equipment, and the reserves upon which my right han. Friend dwelt, we should only
have a total of 960 first-line home-defence aircraft.
What is the comparable German strength? I am not going to give
an estimate and say that the Germans have not got more than a
certain number, but I will take it upon myself to say that they most
certainly at this moment have not got less than a certain number.
Most certainly they have not got less than 1500 first-line aeroplanes,
comprised in not less than 130 or 140 squadrons, including auxiliary
squadrons. It must also be remembered that Germany has not got in
its squadrons any machine the design and construction of which is
more than three years old. It must also be remembered that Germany
has specialised in long-distance bombing aeroplanes and that her
preponderance in that respect is far greater than any of these figures
would suggest.
We were promised most solemnly by the Government that air
parity with Germany would be maintained by the home defence
forces. At the present time, putting everything at the very best, we
are, upon the figures given by the Minister for the Co-ordination of
Defence, only about two-thirds as strong as the German air force,
assuming that I am not very much understating their present
strength. How then does the First Lord of the Admiralty [Sir Samuel
Hoare] think it right to say:
On the whole, our forecast of the strength of other Air Forces proves
to be accurate; on the other hand, our own estimates have also proved
to be accurate.
I am authorised to say that the position is satisfactory.
I simply cannot understand it. Perhaps the Prime Minister will
explain the position. I should like to remind the House that I have
made no revelation affecting this country and that I have introduced
no new fact in our air defence which does not arise from the figures
given by the Minister and from the official estimates that have been
published.
What ought we to do? I know of only one way in which this
matter can be carried further. The House ought to demand a
Parliamentary inquiry. It ought to appoint six, seven or eight
independent Members, responsible, experienced, discreet Members,
who have some acquaintance with these matters and are representative of all parties, to interview Ministers and to find out what are, in
fact, the answers to a series of questions; then to make a brief report
to the House, whether of reassurance or of suggestion for remedying the shortcomings. That, I think, is what any Parliament worthy of
the name would do in these circumstances. Parliaments of the past
days in which the greatness of our country was abuilding would
never have hesitated. They would have felt they could not discharge
their duty to their constituents if they did not satisfy themselves that
the safety of the country was being effectively maintained.
The French Parliament, through its committees, has a very wide,
deep knowledge of the state of national defence, and I am not aware
that their secrets leak out in any exceptional way. There is no reason
why our secrets should leak out in any exceptional way. It is because
so many members of the French Parliament are associated in one way
or another with the progress of the national defence that the French
Government were induced to supply, six years ago, upward of
£60,000,000 sterling to construct the Maginot Line of fortifications,
when our Government was assuring them that wars were over and
that France must not lag behind Britain in her disarmament. Even
now I hope that Members of the House of Commons will rise above
considerations of party discipline, and will insist upon knowing
where we stand in a matter which affects our liberties and our lives. I
should have thought that the Government, and above all the Prime
Minister, whose load is so heavy, would have welcomed such a
suggestion.
Owing to past neglect, in the face of the plainest warnings, we
have now entered upon a period of danger greater than has befallen
Britain since the V-boat campaign was crushed; perhaps, indeed, it is
a more grievous period than that, because at that time at least we
were possessed of the means of securing ourselves and of defeating
that campaign. Now we have no such assurance. The era of
procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a
period of consequences. We have entered a period in which for more
than a year, or a year and a half, the considerable prep<l:rations which
are now on foot in Britain will not, as the Minister clearly showed,
yield results which can be effective in actual fighting strength; while
during this very period Germany may well reach the culminating
point of her gigantic military preparations, and be forced by financial
and economic stringency to contemplate a sharp decline, or perhaps
some other exit from her difficulties. It is this lamentable conjunction
of events which seems to present the danger of Europe in its most
disquieting form. We cannot avoid this period; we are in it now.
Surely, if we can abridge it by even a few months, if we can shorten
this period when the German Army will begin to be so much larger than the French Army, and before the British Air Force has come to
play its complementary part, we may be the architects who build the
peace of the world on sure foundations.
Two things, I confess, have staggered me, after a long Parliamentary experience, in these Debates. The first has been the dangers that
have so swiftly come upon us in a few years, and have been
transforming our position and the whole outlook of the world.
Secondly, I have been staggered by the failure of the House of
Commons to react effectively against those dangers. That, I am
bound to say, I never expected. I never would have believed that we
should have been allowed to go on getting into this plight, month by
month and year by year, and that even the Government's own
confessions of error would have produced no concentration of
Parliamentary opiP.ion and force capable of lifting our efforts to the
level of emergency. I say that unless the House resolves to find out
the truth for itself it will have committed an act of abdication of duty
without parallel in its long history. "
"'Approaching the most dangerous moment', 25 November 1936, London",,"Europe, and it might well be the world, is now approaching the most dangerous moment in history. The struggle which is now opening between rival forms of dictatorships threatens to disturb the internal peace of many countries and to range them against each other. That alone would bring us into grave danger. Yet I feel that danger can be surmounted and kept within bounds if it were not that in this selfsame, ill-starred epoch men had learned to fly. The aeroplane has put all countries and all parts of every country simultaneously at the mercy of a sudden blasting attack. Already, helpless nations have accepted the bombing of open cities and the indiscriminate slaughter of civilian inhabitants as the inevitable commonplace of the routine
of war. What has been planned and was being planned will certainly
in time of war be carried into ruthless effect.
Attack from the air, Inoreover, requires no mobilisation of fleets
and slow gathering of armies. It can be launched by mere word or
gesture; and, once launched, will be irrevocable in its consequences.
It is this conjunction of new air power with the rise of dictatorships
that has brought all countries into a peril unknown in barbarous
times, or even in the most brutal periods of human history. It seems
very unlikely that the world will be able to preserve any semblance of
civilisation unless bombing by air power is brought under complete
control by international organisation.
It follows that, in present circumstances, we are bound to support
all well-considered necessary measures to enable the country to
defend itself and to bear its part in a combined defensive system
against aggression. We view with the strongest reprehension activities like those of Mr Lansbury and Canon Sheppard, who are
ceaselessly trying to dissuade the youth of this country from joining
its defensive forces, and seek to impede and discourage the military
preparations which the state of the world forces upon us.
If it is true, as the Prime Minister stated last week in a deplorable
utterance, that 'democracy is always two years behind the dictator',
then democracy will be destroyed. In the Great War it was the
Parliamentary nations that conquered, and the autocratic Empires
that fell to pieces without exception. If democracy in Great Britain
and in other countries is in danger now, as perhaps it might be, it is
not democracy that is at fault, but the leadership that it has received.
Who should say that Europe cannot save itself if it tries? If
mankind means to have peace, its will can be made effective, but only
if it acts upon a plan and obeys the law on which that plan is based.
If only the people of Spain six months ago could have foreseen the
horror that has overtaken them, how easy it would have been for
them to stop it. When I brood on that tragedy, I ask myself whether
it is not a portent to warn all Europe of the fate which might lie at no
great distance from us all, upon a scale to which the Spanish horror
would be but a small working model. I ask all who are concerned
with peace to rise to the level of events, and to trifle no more on the
edge of the abyss, but to embrace the sacrifices and discipline of mind
and body which the cause requires.

"'The abdication of King Edward VIII', 10 December 1936, House of Commons",,"Nothing is more certain or more obvious than that recrimination or controversy at this time would be not only useless but harmful and wrong. What is done is done. What has been done or left undone belongs to history, and to history, so far as I am concerned, it shall be left. I will, therefore, make two observations only. The first is this: It is clear from what w~ have been told this afternoon that there was at no time any constitutional issue between the King and his Ministers or between the King and Parliament. The supremacy of Parliament over the Crown: the duty of the Sovereign to act in accordance with the advice of his Ministers: neither of those was ever at any moment in question. Supporting my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Liberal party, I venture to say that no Sovereign has ever conformed more strictly or more faithfully to the letter and spirit of the Constitution than his present Majesty. In fact, he has voluntarily made a sacrifice for rhe peace and strength of his Realm which goes far beyond the bounds required by the law and the Constitution. That is my first observation. My second is this: I have, throughout, pleaded for time; anyone can see how grave would have been the evils of protracted controversy. On the other hand, it was, in my view, our duty to endure these evils even at serious inconvenience, if there was any hope that time would bring a solution. Whether there was any hope or not is a mystery which, at the present time, it is impossible to resolve. Time was also important from another point of view. It was essential that there should be no room for aspersions, after the event, that the King had been hurried in his decision. I believe that, if this decision had been taken last week, it could not have been declared that it was an unhurried decision, so far as the King himself was concerned, but now I accept wholeheartedly what the Prime Minister has proved, namely, that the decision taken this week has been taken by His Majesty freely, voluntarily and spontaneously, in his own
time and in his own way. As I have been looking at this matter, as is
well known, from an angle different from that of most hon.
Members, I thought it my duty to place this fact also upon record.
That is all I have to say upon the disputable part of this matter, but
I hope the House will bear with me for a minute or two, because it
was my duty as Home Secretary, more than a quarter of a century
ago, to stand beside his present Majesty and proclaim his style and
titles at his investiture as Prince of Wales amid the sunlit battlements
of Carnarvon Castle, and ever since then he has honoured me here,
and also in wartime, with his personal kindness and, I may even say,
friendship. I should have been ashamed if, in my independent and
unofficial position, I had not cast about for every lawful means, even
the most forlorn, to keep him on the Throne of his fathers, to which
he only recently succeeded amid the hopes and prayers of all. In this
Prince there were discerned qualities of courage, of simplicity, of
sympathy, and, above all, of sincerity, qualities rare and precious
which might have ffiade his reign glorious in the annals of this
ancient monarchy. It is the acme of tragedy that these very virtues
should, in the private sphere, have led only to this melancholy and
bitter conclusion. But, although our hopes today are withered, still I
will assert that his personality will not go down uncherished to future
ages, that it will be particularly remembered in the homes of his
poorer subjects, and that they will ever wish from the bottom of their
hearts for his private peace and happiness and for the happiness of
those who are dear to him.
I must say one word more, and I say it specially to those here and
out of doors - and do not underrate their numbers - who are most
poignantly afflicted by what has occurred. Danger gathers upon our
path. We cannot afford - we have no right - to look back. We must
look forward; we must obey the exhortation of the Prime Minister to
look forward. The stronger the advocate of monarchical principle a
man may be, the more zealously must he now endeavour to fortify
the Throne and to give to His Majesty's successor that strength
which can only come from the love of a united nation and Empire."
"Rudyard Kipling, 17 November 1937, Grosvenor House, London",,"Rudyard Kipling holds one of the foremost places in the last century of English letters. During the long noonday of his activity his literary output, though always distinguished by a sense of rarity, reached impressive dimensions. Behind it lay a volume of knowledge always penetrating, often profound, which was vast and majestic. This knowledge was gathered by ceaseless study, observation, and reflection, and constituted the most wonderful mental possession that can be imagined. To place these treasures at the service of his country and his age there was needed the magic gift of genius. This supreme reagent he enjoyed in a glorious intensity. The pith, the force, the terse and syncopated vivacity of his style immediately arrested and commanded attention. The immense variety of subjects to which he seemed to hold the master-key is a source of unending amazement to his innumerable readers and admirers throughout the King's Dominions and far beyond them. There seemed to be no gallery of human activity which he could not enter easily and unchallenged and which, having entered, he could not illuminate with a light unexpected, piercing, enchanting, and all his own. All sorts of conditions of men, all classes and professions, every part of the Empire, the souls of children, the lives of animals, became in turn visible, intelligible, fascinating to that ever-increasing company by whom he was attended in his journey through life. He created a whole series of new values for his fellowcountrymen and made them participate in an unbroken succession of novel experiences and adventures. There have been in our own time greater poets and sages, more vehement and sentient interpreters of pathos and passion, more fertile stylists than Rudyard Kipling. But in the glittering rank which he took by right Divine there never has been anyone like him. No one has ever written like Kipling before, and his work, with all its characteristics and idiosyncrasies, while it charmed and inspired so many, has been successfully imitated by none. He was unique and irreplaceable. The l~ght of genius expressed in literature does not fail with the death of the author. His galleries are still displayed for our instruction and enjoyment. But the magic key which could have opened new ones to our eager desire has gone forever. Let us, then, guard the treasures which he has bequeathed. The structure and pageant of British rule in India gave him his first and main inspiration. To read with faithful eye Kipling's Indian stories, short or long, is to gain a truer knowledge of that great episode, the British contact with India, than will be found in many ponderous Blue-books, or in much of the glib, smooth patter which is now in fashion. We serve the Queen with 'Soldiers Three'. We see the life of the young officer, of the lonely collector. We satirise the bureaucracy and Viceregal society. We share the domestic troubles of the AngloIndian official, we shed bitter tears with 'Wee Willie Winkle'. On the hard Frontier we follow 'The Drums of the Fore and Aft'. We play polo with the Maltese Cat. We fight for dear life in the skin of the mongoose Rikki against the poison cobra. We roam the jungles with Mowgli, and we walk with Kim among the vast multitudes of Hindustan. Even should the British Empire in India pass from life into history, the works of Rudyard Kipling will remain to prove that while we were there we did our best for all"
"Austria annexed, 14 March 1938, House of Commons",,"The gravity of the event of the 11th of March cannot be exaggerated. Europe is confronted with a programme of aggression, nicely calculated and timed, unfolding stage by stage, and there is only one choice open, not only to us, but to other countries who are unfortunately concerned - either to submit, like Austria, or else to take effective measures while time remains to ward off the danger and, if it cannot be warded off, to cope with it. Resistance will be hard, yet I am persuaded - and the Prime Minister's speech confirms me - that it is to this conclusion of resistance to overweening encroachment that His Majesty's Government will come, and the House of Commons will certainly sustain them in playing a great part in the effort to preserve the peace of Europe, and, if it cannot be preserved, to preserve the freedom of the nations of Europe. If we were to delay, if we were to go on waiting upon events for a considerable period, how much should we throwaway of resources which are now available for our security and for the maintenance of peace? How many friends would be alienated, how many potential allies should we see go, one by one, down the grisly gulf, how many times would bluff succeed, until behind bluff ever-gathering forces had accumulated reality? Where shall we be two years hence, for instance, when the German Army will certainly be much larger than the French Army, a~d wheu all the small nations will have fled from Geneva to pay homage to the ever-waxing power of the Nazi system, and to make the best terms they can for themselves? We cannot leave the Austrian question where it is. We await the further statement of the Government, but it is quite clear that we cannot accept as a final solution of the problem of Central Europe the event which occurred on March 11. The public mind has been concentrated upon the moral and sentimental aspects of the Nazi conquest of Austria - a small country brutally struck down, its Government scattered to the winds, the oppression of the Nazi party doctrine imposed upon a Catholic population and upon the workingclasses of Austria and of Vienna, the hard ill-usage of persecution which indeed will ensue - which is probably in progress at the moment - of those who, this time last week, were exercising their undoubted political rights, discharging their duties faithfully to their own country. All this we see very clearly, but there are some things which I have not seen brought out in the public Press and which do not seem to be present in the public mind, and they are practical considerations of the utmost significance. Vienna is the centre of all the communication of all the countries which formed the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, and of all the countries lying to the south-east of Europe. A long stretch of the Danube is now in German hands. This mastery of Vienna gives to Nazi Germany military and economic control of the whole of the communications of south-eastern Europe, by road, by river, and by rail. What is the effect of it upon what is called the balance of power,
such as it is, and upon what is called the Little Entente? I must say a
word about this group of Powers called the Little Entente. Taken
singly, the three countries of the Little Entente may be called Powers
of the second rank, but they are very vigorous States, and united they
are a Great Power. They have hitherto been, and are, still, united by
the closest military agreement. Together they make the complement
of a Great Power and of the military machinery of a Great Power.
Rumania has the oil; Yugoslavia has the minerals and raw materials.
Both have large armies; both are mainly supplied with munitions
from Czechoslovakia. To English ears, the name of Czechoslovakia
sounds outlandish. No doubt they are only a small democratic State,
no doubt they have an army only two or three times as large as ours,
no doubt they have a munitions supply only three times as great as
that of Italy, but still they are a virile people; they have their treaty
rights, they have a line of fortresses, and they have a strongly
manifested will to live freely.
Czechoslovakia is 2.t this moment isolated, both in the economic
and in the military sense. Her trade outlet through Hamburg, which
is based upon the Peace Treaty, can, of course, be closed at any
moment. Now her communications by rail and river to the south,
and after the south to the south-east, are liable to be severed at any
moment. Her trade may be subjected to tolls of an absolutely
strangling character. Here is a country which was once the greatest
manufacturing area in the old Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is now
cut off, or may be cut off at once unless, out of these discussions
which must follow, arrangements are made securing the communications of Czechoslovakia. You may be cut off at once from the sources
of her raw material in Yugoslavia and from the natural markets
which she has established there. The economic life of this small State
may be practically destroyed as a result of the act of violence which
was perpetrated last Friday night. A wedge has been driven into the
heart of what is called the Little Entente, this group of countries
which have as much right to live in Europe unmolested as any of us
have the right to live unmolested in our native land.
It would be too complicated to pursue the economic, military, and
material reactions, apart from moral sentiments altogether, into the
other countries. It would take too long, but the effects of what has
happened now upon Rumania, upon Hungary, upon Bulgaria, upon
Turkey, must be the subject of the closest possible study, not only by
His Majesty's Government, but by all who aspire to take part in the
public discussion of these matters. By what has happened it is not too much to say that Nazi Germany, in its present mood, if matters are
left as they are, is in a position to dominate the whole of south-east
Europe. Over an area inhabited perhaps by 200,000,000 of people
Nazidom and all that it involves is moving on to absolute
control. ...
It seems to me quite clear that we cannot possibly confine ourselves
only to a renewed effort at rearmament. I know that some of my
hon. Friends on this side of the House will laugh when I offer them
this advice. I say, 'Laugh, but listen.' I affirm that the Government
should express in the strongest terms our adherence to the Covenant
of the League of Nations and our resolve to procure by international
action the reign of law in Europe. I agree entirely with what has been
said by the Leaders of the two Opposition parties upon that subject;
and I was extremely glad to notice that at the beginning and in the
very forefront of his speech the Prime Minister referred to the League
of Nations and made that one of the bases of our right to intervene
and to be consulted upon affairs in Central Europe. The matter has
an importance in this country. There must be a moral basis for
British rearmament and British foreign policy. We must have that
basis if we are to unite and inspire our people and procure their
wholehearted action, and if we are to stir the English-speaking
people throughout the world.
Our affairs have come to such a pass that there is no escape
without running risks. On every ground of prudence as well as of
duty I urge His Majesty's Government to proclaim a renewed,
revivified, unflinching adherence w the Covenant of the League of
Nations. What is there ridiculous about collective security? The only
thing that is ridiculous about it is that we have not got it. Let us see
whether we cannot do something to procure a strong element of
collective security for ourselves and for others. We have been urged
to make common cause in self-defence with the French Republic.
What is that but the beginning of collective security? I agree with
that. Not so lightly will the two great liberal democracies of the West
be challenged, and not so easily, if challenged, will they be
subjugated. That is the beginning of collective security. But why stop
there? Why be edged and pushed farther down the slope in a
disorderly expostulating crowd of embarrassed States. Why not
make a stand while there is still a good company of united, very
powerful countries that share our dangers and aspirations? Why
should we delay until we are confronted with a general landslide of
those small countries passing over, because they have no other
choice, to the overwhelming power of the Nazi regime? If a number of States were assembled around Great Britain and
France in a solemn treaty for mutual defence against aggression; if
they had their forces marshalled in what ~u may call a Grand
Alliance; if they had their Staff arrangements concerted; if all this
rested, as it can honourably rest, upon the Covenant of the League of
Nations, in pursuance of all the purposes and ideals of the League of
Nations; if that were sustained, as it would be, by the moral sense of
the world; and if it were done in the year 1938 - and, believe me, it
may be the last chance there will be for doing it - then I say that you
might even now arrest this approaching war. Then perhaps the curse
which overhangs Europe would pass away. Then perhaps the
ferocious passions which now grip a great people would turn
inwards and not outwards in an internal rather than an external
explosion, and mankind would be spared the deadly ordeal towards
which we have been sagging and sliding month by month. I have
ventured to indicate a positive conception, a practical and realistic
conception, and one which I am convinced will unite all the forces of
this country without whose help your armies cannot be filled or your
munitions made. Before we cast away this hope, this cause and this
plan, which I do not at all disguise has an element of risk, let those
who wish to reject it ponder well and earnestly upon what will
happen to us if, when all else has been thrown to the wolves, we are
left to face our fate alone. "
"I have watched this famous island .. .', 24 March 1938, House of Commons",,"The Prime Minister [Neville Chamberlain], in what I think it is not presumptuous for me to describe as a very fine speech, set before us the object which is in all our minds - namely, how tOiprevent war. A
country like ours, possessed of immense territory and wealth, whose
defences have been neglected, cannot avoid war by dilating upon its
horrors, or even by a continuous display of pacific qualities, or by
ignoring the fate of the victims of aggression elsewhere. War will be
avoided, in present circumstances, only by the accumulation of
deterrents against the aggressor. If our defences are weak, we must
seek allies; and, of course, if we seek allies, alliances involve
commitments. But the increase of commitments may be justified if it
is followed by a still greater increase of deterrents against aggression.
I was very glad to hear the Prime Minister reaffirm in such direct
terms our arrangements for mutual defence with the French
Republic. Evidently they amount to a defensive alliance. Why not say
so? Why not make it effective by a military convention of the most
detailed character? Are we, once again, to have all the disadvantages of
an alliance without its advantages, and to have commitments without
full security? Great Britain and France have to stand together for
mutual protection. Why should not the conditions be worked out
precisely and the broad facts made public? Everyone knows, for
instance, that our Air Force is tripled in deterrent effectiveness if it
operates from French bases and, as I pointed out in the House three
weeks ago, the fact that an attack upon this country would bring the
attacker into conflict with the French Army is another great security to
us here. We are obliged in return to go to the aid of France, and hitherto
we have always been better than our word.
Here, then, is the great security for the two countries. Do not
conceal it. Proclaim it, implement it, work it out in thorough detail.
Treat the defensive problems of the two countries as if they were one.
Then you will have a real deterrent against unprovoked aggression,
and if the deterrent fails to deter, you will have a highly organised
method of coping with the aggressor. The present rulers of Germany
will hesitate long before they attack the British Empire and the
French Republic if those are woven together for defence purposes
into one very powerful unit. Having gone so far, there is no safe
halting-place short of an open defensive alliance with France, not
with loose obligations, but with defined obligations on both sides
and complete inter-staff arrangements. Even an isolationist would, I
think, go so far as to say, 'If we have to mix ourselves up with the
Continent, let us, at any rate, get the maximum of safety from our
commitments.' ...
I must say I do not feel sure even now, after this latest decision,
that the problem of rearmament is being dealt with on the right lines. Is the method of organisation to be employed adapted to a nationwide effort? Ought there not to be created, however tardily, a
Ministry of Supply? Ought there not be created a far more effective
Ministry of Defence? Are there not problems pressing for solution
which can be handled only by a Minister of Defence? Ought there
not to be a Defence of the Realm Act giving the necessary powers to
divert industry, as far as may be necessary, from the ordinary
channels of commerce so as to fit our rearmament in with the needs
of our export trade and yet make sure that rearmament has the
supreme priority?
I will venture to echo the question which was posed by Mr Amery
last week. Is our system of government adapted to the present fierce,
swift movement of events? Twenty-two gentlemen of blameless party
character sitting round an overcrowded table, each having a voice -
is that a system which can reach decisions from week to week and
cope with the problems descending upon us and with the men at the
head of dictator States? It broke down hopelessly in the war. But is
this peace in which we are living? Is it not war without cannon
firing? Is it not war of a decisive character, where victories are gained
and territories conquered, and where ascendancy and dominance are
established over large populations with extraordinary rapidity? If we
are to prevent this bloodless war being turned into bloody war,
ought not His Majesty's Government to adopt a system more on a
level with the period of crisis in which we live? ...
Let me give a warning drawn from our recent experiences. Very
likely this immediate crisis will pass, will dissipate itself and calm
down. After a boa constrictor has devoured its prey it often has a
considerable digestive spell. It was so after the revelation of the secret
German air force. There was a pause. It was so after German
conscription was proclaimed in breach of the Treaty. It was so after
the Rhineland was forcibly occupied. The House may recall that we
were told how glad we ought to be because there would be no
question of fortifying it. Now, after Austria has been struck down,
we are all disturbed and alarmed, but in a little while there may be
another pause. There may not - we cannot tell. But if there is a
pause, then people will be saying, 'See how the alarmists have been
confuted; Europe has calmed down, it has all blown over, and the
war scare has passed away.' The Prime Minister will perhaps repeat
what he said a few weeks ago, that the tension in Europe is greatly
relaxed. The Times will write a leading article to say how silly those
people look who on the morrow of the Austrian incorporation raised
a clamour for exceptional action in foreign policy and home defence, and how wise the Government were not to let themselves be carried
away by this passing incident.
All this time the vast degeneration of the forces of Parliamentary
democracy will be proceeding throughout Europe. Every six weeks
another corps will be added to the German army. All this time
important countries and great rail and river communications will
pass under the control of the German General Staff. All this time
populations will be continually reduced to the rigours of Nazi
domination and assimiiated to that system. All this time the forces of
conquest and intimidation will be consolidated, towering up soon in
real and not make-believe strength and superiority. Then presently
will come another stroke. Upon whom? Our questions with
Germany are unsettled and unanswered. We cannot tell. What I
dread is that the impulse now given to active effort may pass away
when the dangers are nor diminishing, but accumulating and
gathering as country after country is involved in the Nazi system, and
as their vast preparations reach their final perfection.
For five years I have talked to the House on these matters - not
with very great success. I have watched this famous island descending
incontinently, fecklessly, the stairway which leads to a dark gulf. It is
a fine broad stairway at the beginning, but after a bit the carpet ends.
A little farther on there are only flagstones, and a little farther on still
these break beneath your feet. Look back over the last five years. It is
true that great mistakes were made in the years immediately after the
war. But at Locarno we laid the fcundation from which a great
forward movement could have been made. Look back upon the last
five years - since, that is to say, Germany began to rearm in earnest
and openly to seek revenge. If we study the history of Rome and
Carthage, we can understand what happened and why. It is not
difficult to form an intelligent view about the three Punic Wars; but if
mortal catastrophe should overtake the British Nation and the
British Empire, historians a thousand years hence will still be baffled
by the mystery of our affairs. They will never understand how it was
that a victorious nation, with everything in hand, suffered themselves
to be brought low, and to cast away all that they had gained by
measureless sacrifice and absolute victory - gone with the wind!
Now the victors are the vanquished, and those who threw down
their arms in the field and sued for an armistice are striding on to
world mastery. That is the position - that is the terrible transformation that has taken place bit by bit. I rejoice to hear from the Prime
Minister that a further supreme effort is to be made to place us in a position of security. Now is the time at last to rouse the nation.
Perhaps it is the last time it can be roused with a chance of preventing
war, or with a chance of coming through to victory should our
efforts to prevent war fail. We should lay aside every hindrance and
endeavour by uniting the whole force and spirit of our people to raise
again a great British nation standing up before all the world; for such
a nation, rising in its ancient vigour, can even at this hour save
civilisation. "
"The sentinel towers of the Western approaches', 5 May 1938, House of Commons",,"I confess that I was wholly unprepared to read in the newspapers that
we have abandoned all our contentions about the repudiation of the
Treaty, about the annuities, and, above all - and this is the subject
which makes me feel compelled to speak - our contentions about the
strategic ports. It is this issue of the strategic ports which makes me
undertake the thankless task of bringing some of these matters very
respectfully to the attention of the House. The ports in question,
Queenstown, Berehaven and Lough Swilly, are to be handed over
unconditionally, with no guarantees of any kind, as a gesture of our
trust and goodwill, as the Prime Minister said, to the Government of
the Irish Republic. When the Irish Treaty was being shaped in 1921 I
was instructed by the Cabinet to prepare that part of the Agreement
which dealt with strategic reservations. I negotiated with Mr Michael
Collins, and I was advised by Admiral Beatty, who had behind him
the whole staff of the Admiralty, which had just come out of the
successful conduct of the Great \Var. Therefore, we had high authority in prescribing the indispensable minimum of reservations
for strategic security.
The Admiralty of those days assured me that without the use of
these ports it would be very difficult, perhaps almost impossible, to
feed this Island in time of war. Queenstown and Berehaven shelter
the flotillas which keep clear the approaches to the Bristol and
English Channels, and Lough Swilly is the base from which the
access to the Mersey and the Clyde is covered. In a war against an
enemy possessing a nnmerous and powerful fleet of submarines these
are the essential bases from which the whole operation of hunting
submarines and protecting incoming convoys is conducted. I am very
sorry to have to strike a jarring note this afternoon, but all opinions
should be heard and put on record. If we are denied the use of Lough
Swilly and have to work from Lamlash, we should strike 200 miles
from the effective radius of our flotillas, out and home; and if we are
denied Berehaven and Queenstown, and have to work from
Pembroke Dock, we should strike 400 miles from their effective
radius out and home. These ports are, in fact, the sentinel towers of
the western approaches, by which the 45,000,000 people in this
Island so enormously depend on foreign food for their daily bread,
and by which they can carryon their trade, which is equally
important to their existence.
In 1922 the Irish delegates made no difficulty about this. They saw
that it was vital to our safety that we should be able to use these
ports and, therefore, the matter passed into the structure of the
Treaty without any serious controversy. Now we are to give them
up, unconditionally, to an Irish Government led by men - I do not
want to use hard words - whose rise to power has been proportionate to the animosity with which they have acted against this country,
no doubt in pursuance of their own patriotic impulses, and whose
present position in power is based upon the violation of solemn
Treaty engagements ....
I wish it were possible, even at this stage, to postpone the passage
of the Bill- I put it to the Prime Minister, if I may, even at this stageuntil some further arrangements could be made about the Treaty
ports, or some more general arrangement could be made about
common action and defence. Would it not be far better to give up the
£10,000,000, and acquire the legal right, be it only on a lease
granted by treaty, to use these harbours when necessary? Surely,
there should be some right retained. The garrisons, of course, are at
present only small ones, little more than care and maintainance
parties. It would be a serious step for a Dublin Government to attack these forts while they are in our possession and while we have the
right to occupy them. It would be an easy step for a Dublin
Government to deny their use to us once we have gone. The cannon
are there, the mines will be there. But more important for this
purpose, the juridical right will be there. We are going away, we are
giving up the ports, and giving to this other Government the right as
well as the power to forbid our re-entry. You had the rights. You
have ceded them. You hope in their place to have goodwill, strong
enough to endure tribulation for your sake. Suppose you have it not.
It will be no use saying, 'Then we will retake the ports.' You will
have no right to do so. To violate Irish neutrality, should it be
declared at the moment of a great war, may put you out of court in
the opinion of the world, and may vitiate the cause by which you
may be involved in war. If ever we have to fight again, we shall be
fighting in the name of law, of respect for the rights of small
countries - Belgium, for instance - and upon that basis and within
the ambit of the Covenant of the League of Nations.
When we are pr;)ceeding, as we should be in such unhappy
circumstances, upon the basis of law and equity, how could we
justify ourselves if we began by violating the neutrality of what the
world regard, and what we are teaching the world to regard, as
the Independent Irish Republic? At the moment when the goodwill of
the United States in matters of blockade and supply might be of the
highest possible consequence, you might be forced to take violent
action against all law and accepted usage, or alternatively you might
be forced to sacrifice Ulster or, in the third place, do without the use
of these almost vitally important strategic ports. What is it all being
done for? What are the new facts which have led to this sudden
departure? To me, it is incomprehensible. To the world, to all the
hungry aggressive nations, it will be taken as another sign that
Britain has only to be pressed and worried long enough and hard
enough for her to give way. If that is so, by that very fact you will
bring the possibility of war nearer and you will lessen your resources
for dealing with that danger. You are inviting demands from every
quarter. You are casting away real and important means of security
and survival for vain shadows and for ease."
"'Save mankind from martyrdom', 26 September 1938, London",,"There is still one good chance of preserving peace. A solemn warning
should be presented to the German Government in joint or
simultaneous Notes by Great Britain, France, and Russia that the
invasion of Czechoslovakia at the present juncture would be taken as
an act of war against these Powers. The terms of this Note should be
communicated to all neutral countries, some of whom may be
balancing their actions, and most particularly to the Government of
the USA.
If such steps had been taken a month ago it is improbable matters
would have reached their present pass. Even at the last moment clear
and resolute action may avert the catastrophe into which we are
drifting. Not only the German Government but the German people
have a right to know where we all stand.
If the Government and people of the USA have a word to speak for
the salvation of the world, now is the time and now is the last time
when words will be of any use. Afterwards, through years of struggle
and torment, deeds alone will serve and deeds will be forthcoming. It
will indeed be a tragedy if this last effort is not made in the only way
in which it may be effective to save mankind from martyrdom. "
"'A total and unmitigated defeat', 5 October 1938, House of Commons",,"If I do not begin this afternoon by paying the usual, and indeed almost invariable, tributes to the Prime Minister for his handling of this crisis, it is certainly not from any lack of personal regard. We have always, over a great many years, had very pleasant relations, and I have deeply understood from personal experiences of my own in a similar crisis the stress and strain he has had to bear; but I am sure it is much better to say exactly what we think about public affairs, and this is certainly not the time when it is worth anyone's while to court political popularity. We had a shining example of firmness of character from the late First Lord of the Admiralty two days ago. He showed that firmness of character which is utterly unmoved by currents of opinion, however swift and violent they may be. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hull (Mr Law), to whose compulsive speech the House listened on Monday - which I had not the good fortune to hear, but which I read, and which I am assured by all who heard it revived the memory of his famous father, so cherished in this House, and made us feel that his gifts did not die with him - was quite right in reminding us that the Prime Minister has himself throughout his conduct of these matters shown a robust indifference to cheers or boos and to the alternations of criticism and applause. If that be so, such qualities and elevation of mind should make it possible for the most severe expressions of honest opinion to be interchanged in this House without rupturing personal relations, and for all points of view to receive the fullest possible expression. Having thus fortified myself by the example of others, I will proceed to emulate them. I will, therefore, begin by saying the most
unpopular and most unwelcome thing. I will begin by saying what
everybody would like to ignore or forget but which must nevertheless
be stated, namely, that we have sustained a total and unmitigated
defeat, and that France has suffered even more than we have.
Viscountess Astor: Nonsense.
Mr Churchill: When the Noble Lady cries 'Nonsense', she could
not have heard the Chancellor of the Exchequer [Sir John Simon]
admit in his illuminating and comprehensive speech just now that
Herr Hitler had gained in this particular leap forward in substance all
he set out to gain. The utmost my right hon. Friend the Prime
Minister has been able to secure by all his immense exertions, by all
the great efforts and mobilisations which took place in this country,
and by all the anguish and strain through which we have passed in
this country, the utmost he has been able to gain - [Han. Members:
'Is peace.'] I thought I might be allowed to make that point in its due
place, and I propose to deal with it. The utmost he has been able to
gain for Czechoslovakia and in the matters which were in dispute has
been that the German dictator, instead of snatching his victuals from
the table, has been content to have them served to him course by
course.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said it was the first time Herr
Hitler had been made to retract - I think that was the word - in any
degree. We really must not waste time, after all this long debate,
upon the difference between the positions reached at Berchtesgaden,
at Godesberg and at Munich. They can be very simply epitomised, if
the House will permit me to vary the metaphor. £1 was demanded at
the pistol's point. When it was given, £2 were demanded at the
pistol's point. Finally, the dictator consented to take £1 175. 6d. and
the rest in promises of goodwill for the future.
Now I come to the point, which was mentioned to me just now
from some quarters of the House, about the saving of peace. No one
has been a more resolute and uncompromising struggler for peace
than the Prime Minister. Everyone knows that. Never has there been
such intense and undaunted determination to maintain and to secure
peace. That is quite true. Nevertheless, I am not quite clear why there
was so much danger of Great Britain or France being involved in a
war with Germany at this juncture if, in fact, they were ready all
along to sacrifice Czechoslovakia. The terms which the Prime
Minister brought back with him - I quite agree at the last moment;
everything had got off the rails and nothing but his intervention
could have saved the peace, but I am talking of the events of the summer - could easily have been agreed, I believe, through the
ordinary diplomatic channels at any time during the summer. And I
will say this, that I believe the Czechs, left to themselves and told they
were going to get no help from the Western Powers, would have been
able to make better terms than they have got - they could hardly
have worse - after all this tremendous perturbation.
There never can be any absolute certainty that there will be a fight
if one side is determined that it will give way completely. When one
reads the Munich terms, when one sees what is happening in
Czechoslovakia from hour to hour, when one is sure, I will not say of
Parliamentary approval but of Parliamentary acquiescence, when the
Chancellor of the Exchequer makes a speech which at any rate tries
to put in a very powerful and persuasive manner the fact that, after
all, it was inevitable .md indeed righteous - right - when we sawall
this, and everyone on this side of the House, including many
Members of the Conservative Party who are supposed to be vigilant
and careful guardians of the national interest, it is quite clear that
nothing vitally affectiag us was at stake, it seems to me that one must
ask, What was all the trouble and fuss about?
The resolve was taken by the British and the French Governments.
Let me say that it is very important to realise that it is by no means a
question which the British Government only have had to decide. I
very much admire the manner in which, in the House, all references
of a recriminatory nature have been repressed, but it must be realised
that this resolve did not emanate particularly from one or other of
the Governments but was a resolve for which both must share in
common the responsibility. When this resolve was taken and the
course was followed - you may say it was wise or unwise, prudent or
short-sighted - once it had been decided not to make the defence of
Czechoslovakia a matter of war, then there was really no reason, if
the matter had been handled during the summer in the ordinary way,
to call into being all this formidable apparatus of crisis. I think that
point should be considered.
We are asked to vote for this Motion [That this House approves
the policy of His Majesty's Government by which war was averted in
the recent crisis and supports their efforts to secure a lasting peace']
which has been put upon the Paper, and it is certainly a Motion
couched in very uncontroversial terms, as, indeed, is the Amendment
moved from the Opposition side. I cannot myself express my
agreement with the steps which have been taken and, as the
Chancellor of the Exchequer has put his side of the case with so
much ability I will attempt, if I may be permitted, to put the case from a different angle. I have always held the view that the
maintenance of peace depends upon the accumulation of deterrents
against the aggressor, coupled with a sincere effort to redress
grievances. Herr Hitler's victory, like so many of the famous
struggles that have governed the fate of the world, was won upon the
narrowest of margins. After the seizure of Austria in March we faced
this problem in our Debates. I ventured to appeal to the Government
to go a little further than the Prime Minister went, and to give a
pledge that in conjunction with France and other Powers they would
guarantee the security of Czechoslovakia while the Sudeten-Deutsch
question was being examined either by a League of Nations
Commission or some other impartial body, and I still believe that if
that course had been followed events would not have fallen into this
disastrous state. I agree very much with my right hon. Friend the
Member for Spark brook (Mr Amery) when he said on that occasion
- I cannot remember his actual words - 'Do one thing or the other:
either say you will disinterest yourself in the matter altogether or take
the step of giving a ;uarantee which will have the greatest chance of
securing protection for that country.'
France and Great Britain together, especially if they had maintained a close contact with Russia, which certainly was not done,
would have been able in those days in the summer, when they had
the prestige, to influence many of the smaller States of Europe, and I
believe they could have determined the attitude of Poland. Such a
combination, prepared at a time when the German dictator was not
deeply and irrevocably committed to his new adventure, would, I
believe, have given strength to all those forces in Germany which
resisted this departure, this new design. They were varying forces,
those of a military character which declared that Germany was not
ready to undertake a world war, and all that mass of moderate
opinion and popular opinion which dreaded war, and some elements
of which still have some influence upon the German Government.
Such action would have given strength to all that intense desire for
peace which the helpless German masses share with their British and
French fellow men, and which, as we have been reminded, found a
passionate and rarely permitted vent in the joyous manifestations
with which the Prime Minister was acclaimed in Munich.
All these forces, added to the other deterrents which combinations
of Powers, great and small, ready to stand firm upon the front of law
and for the ordered remedy of grievances, would have formed, might
well have been effective. Of course you cannot say for certain that
they would. [Interruption.] I try to argue fairly with the House. At the same time I do not think it is fair to charge those who wished to
see this course followed, and followed consistently and resolutely,
with having wished for an immediate war. Between submission and
immediate war there was this third alternative, which gave a hope
not only of peace but of justice. It is quite true that such a policy in
order to succeed demanded that Britain should declare straight out
and a long time beforehand that she would, with others, join to
defend Czechoslovakia against an unprovoked aggression. His
Majesty's Government refused to give that guarantee when it would
have saved the situation, yet in the end they gave it when it was too
late, and now, for the future, they renew it when they have not the
slightest power to make it good.
All is over. Silent, mournful, abandoned, broken, Czechoslovakia
recedes into the darkness. She has suffered in every respect by her
association with the Western democracies and with the League of
Nations, of which she has always been an obedient servant. She has
suffered in particular from her association with France, under whose
guidance and policy she has been actuated for so long. The very
measures taken by His Majesty's Government in the Anglo-French
Agreement to give her the best chance possible, namely, the 50 per
cent clean cut in certain districts instead of a plebiscite, have turned
to her detriment, because there is to be a plebiscite, too, in wide
areas, and those other Powers who had claims have also come down
upon the helpless victim. Those municipal elections upon whose
voting the basis is taken for the 50 per cent cut were held on issues
which had nothing to do with joining Germany. When I saw Herr
Henlein over here he assured me that was not the desire of his people.
Positive statements were made that it was only a question of home
rule, of having a position of their own in the Czechoslovakian State.
No one has a right to say that the plebiscite which is to be taken in
areas under Saar conditions, and the clean-cut of the 50 per cent
areas - that those two operations together amount to the slightest
degree to a verdict of self-determination. It is a fraud and a farce to
invoke that name.
We in this country, as in other Liberal and democratic countries,
have a perfect right to exalt the principle of self-determination, but it
comes ill out of the mouths of those in totalitarian States who deny
even the smallest element of toleration to every section and creed
within their bounds. But, however you put it, this particular block of
land, this mass of human beings to be handed over, has never
expressed the desire to go into the Nazi rule. I do not believe that even now - if their opinion could be asked - they would exercise
such an option.
What is the remaining position of Czechoslovakia? Not only are
they politically mutilated, but, economically and financially, they are
in complete confusion. Their banking, their railway arrangements,
are severed and broken, their industries are curtailed, and the
movement of their population is most cruel. The Sudeten miners,
who are all Czechs and whose families have lived in that area for
centuries, must now flee into an area where there are hardly any
mines left for them to work. It is a tragedy which has occurred. I did
not like to hear the Minister of Transport yesterday talking about
Humpty Dumpty. It was the Minister of Transport who was saying
that it was a case of Humpty Dumpty that could never be put
together again. There must always be the most profound regret and a
sense of vexation in British hearts at the treatment and the
misfortunes which have overcome the Czechoslovakian Republic.
They have not ended here. At any moment there may be a hitch in
the programme. At ""'ny moment there may be an order for Herr
Goebbels to start again his propaganda of calumny and lies; at any
moment an incident may be provoked, and now that the fortress line
is given away what is there to stop the will of the conqueror?
[Interruption.] It is too serious a subject to treat lightly. Obviously,
we are not in a position to give them the slightest help at the present
time, except what everyone is glad to know has been done, the
financial aid which the Government have promptly produced.
I venture to think that in future the Czechoslovak State cannot be
maintained as an independent entity. You will find that in a period of
time which may be measured by years, but may be measured only by
months, Czechoslovakia will be engulfed in the Nazi regime. Perhaps
they may join it in despair or in revenge. At any rate, that story is
over and told. But we cannot consider the abandonment and ruin of
Czechoslovakia in the light only of what happened only last month.
It is the most grievous consequence which we have yet experienced of
what we have done and of what we have left undone in the last five
years - five years of futile good intention, five years of eager search
started for the line of least resistance, five years of uninterrupted
retreat of British power, five years of neglect of our air defences.
Those are the features which I stand here to declare and which
marked an improvident stewardship for which Great Britain and
France have dearly to pay. We have been reduced in those five years
from a position of security so overwhelming and so unchallengeable
that we never cared to think about it. We have been reduced from a position where the very word 'war' was considered one which would
be used only by persons qualifying for a lunatic asylum. We have
been reduced from a position of safety and power - power to do
good, power to be generous to a beaten foe, power to make terms
with Germany, power to give her proper redress for her grievances,
power to stop her arming if we chose, power to take any step in
strength or mercy or justice which we thought right - reduced in five
years from a position safe and unchallenged to where we stand now.
When I think of the fair hopes of a long peace which still lay before
Europe at the beginning of 1933 when Herr Hitler first obtained
power, and of all the opportunities of arresting the growth of the
Nazi power which have been thrown away, when I think of the
immense combinations and resources which have been neglected or
squandered, I cannot believe that a parallel exists in the whole course
of history. So far as this country is concerned the responsibility must
rest with those who have the undisputed control of our political
affairs. They neither prevented Germany from rearming, nor did they
rearm ourselves in time. They quarrelled with Italy without saving
Ethiopia. They exploited and discredited the vast institution of the
League of Nations and they neglected to make alliances and
combinations which might have repaired previous errors, and thus
they left us in the hour of trial without adequate national defence or
effective international security.
In my holiday I thought it was a chance to study the reign of King
Ethelred the Unready. The House will remember that that was a
period of great misfortune, in which, from the strong position which
we had gained under the descendants of King Alfred, we fell very
swiftly into chaos. It was the period of Danegeld and of foreign
pressure. I must say that the rugged words of the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle, written 1,000 years ago, seem to me apposite, at least as
apposite as those quotations from Shakespeare with which we have
been regaled by the last speaker from the Opposition Bench. Here is
what the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle said, and I think the words apply
very much to our treatment of Germany and our relations with her:
All these calamities fell upon us because of evil counsel, because
tribute was not offered to them at the right time nor yet were they
resisted; but when they had done the most evil, then was peace made
with them.
That is the wisdom of the past, for all wisdom is not new wisdom.
I have ventured to express those views in justifying myself for not being able to support the Motion which is moved tonight, but I
recognise that this great matter of Czechoslovakia, and of British and
French duty there, has passed into history. New developments may
come along, but we are not here to decide whether any of those steps
should be taken or not. They have been taken. They have been taken
by those who had a right to take them because they bore the highest
executive responsibility under the Crown. Whatever we may think of
it, we must regard those steps as belonging to the category of affairs
which are settled beyond recall. The past is no more, and one can
only draw comfort if one feels that one has done one's best to advise
rightly and wisely and in good time. I therefore, turn to the future,
and to our situation as it is today. Here, again, I am sure I shall have
to say something which will not be at all welcome.
We are in the presence of a disaster of the first magnitude which
has befallen Great Britain and France. Do not let us blind ourselves
to that. It must now be accepted that all the countries of Central and
Eastern Europe will make the best terms they can with the
triumphant Nazi Povrer. The system of alliances in Central Europe
upon which France has relied for her safety has been swept away,
and I can see no means by which it can be reconstituted. The road
down the Danube Valley to the Black Sea, the resources of corn and
oil, the road which leads as far as Turkey, has been opened. In fact, if
not in form, it seems to me that all those countries of Middle Europe,
all those Danubian countries, will, one after another, be drawn into
this vast system of power politics - not only power military politics
but power economic politics - radiating from Berlin, and I believe
this can be achieved quite smoothly and swiftly and will not
necessarily entail the firing of a single shot ....
You will see, day after day, week after week, entire alienation of
those regions. Many of those countries, in fear of the rise of the Nazi
Power, have already got politicians, Ministers, Governments, who
were pro-German, but there was always an enormous popular
movement in Poland, Rumania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia which
looked to the Western democracies and loathed the idea of having
this arbitrary rule of the totalitarian system thrust upon them, and
hoped that a stand would be made. All that has gone by the board.
We are talking about countries which are a long way off and of
which, as the Prime Minister might say, we know nothing.
[Interruption.] The noble Lady says that that very harmless allusion
IS -
Viscountess Astor: Rude.
Mr Churchill: She must very recently have been recelVlng her finishing course in manners. What will be the position, I want to
know, of France and England this year and the year afterwards?
What will be the position of that Western front of which we are in
full authority the guarantors? The German army at the present time
is more numerous than that of France, though not nearly so matured
or perfected. Next year it will grow much larger, and its maturity will
be more complete. Relieved from all anxiety in the East, and having
secured resources which will greatly diminish, if not entirely remove,
the deterrent of a naval blockade, the rulers of Nazi Germany will
have a free choice open to them in what direction they will turn their
eyes. If the Nazi dictator should choose to look westward, as he may,
bitterly will France and England regret the loss of that fine army of
ancient Bohemia which was estimated last week to require not fewer
than 30 German divisions for its destruction.
Can we blind ourselves to the great change which has taken place
in the military situation, and to the dangers we have to meet? We are
in process, I believe, of adding, in four years, four battalions to the
British Army. No fewer than two have already been completed. Here
are at least 30 divisions which must now be taken into consideration
upon the French front, besides the 12 that were captured when
Austria was engulfed. Many people, no doubt, honestly believe that
they are only giving away the interests of Czechoslovakia, whereas I
fear we shall find that we have deeply compromised, and perhaps
fatally endangered, the safety and even the independence of Great
Britain and France. This is not merely a question of giving up the
German colonies, as I am sure we shall be asked to do. Nor is it a
question only of losing influence in Europe. It goes far deeper than
that. You have to consider the character of the Nazi movement and
the rule which it implies. The Prime Minister desires to see cordial
relations between this country and Germany. There is no difficulty at
all in having cordial relations with the German people. Our hearts go
out to them. But they have no power. You must have diplomatic and
correct relations, but there can never be friendship between the
British democracy and the Nazi Power, that Power which spurns
Christian ethics, which cheers its onward course by a barbarous
paganism, which vaunts the spirit of aggression and conquest, which
derives strength and perverted pleasure from persecution, and uses,
as we have seen, with pitiless brutality the threat of murderous force.
That Power cannot ever be the trusted friend of the British
democracy.
What I find unendurable is the sense of our country falling into the
power, into the orbit and influence of Nazi Germany, and of our existence becoming dependent upon their goodwill or pleasure. It is
to prevent that that I have tried my best to urge the maintenance of
every bulwark of defence - first the timely creation of an Air Force
superior to anything within striking distance of our shores; secondly,
the gathering together of the collective strength of many nations; and
thirdly, the making of alliances and military conventions, all within
the Covenant, in order to gather together forces at any rate to
restrain the onward movement of this Power. It has all been in vain.
Every position has been successively undermined and abandoned on
specious and plausible excuses. We do not want to be led upon the
high road to becoming a satellite of the German Nazi system of
European domination. In a very few years, perhaps in a very few
months, we shall be confronted with demands with which we shall
no doubt be invited to comply. Those demands may affect the
surrender of territory or the surrender of liberty. I foresee and foretell
that the policy of submission will carry with it restrictions upon the
freedom of speech and debate in Parliament, on public platforms,
and discussions in the Press, for it will be said - indeed, I hear it said
sometimes now - that we cannot allow the Nazi system of
dictatorship to be criticised by ordinary, common English politicians.
Then, with a Press under control, in part direct but more potently
indirect, with every organ of public opinion doped and chloroformed
into acquiescence, we shall be conducted along further stages of our
Journey ....
I have been casting about to see how measures can be taken to
protect us from this advance of the Nazi Power, and to secure those
forms of life which are so dear to us. What is the sole method that is
open? The sole method that is open is for us to regain our old island
independence by acquiring that supremacy in the air which we were
promised, that security in our air defences which we were assured we
had, and thus to make ourselves an island once again. That, in all
this grim outlook, shines out as the overwhelming fact. An effort at
rearmament the like of which has not been seen ought to be made
forthwith, and all the resources of this country and all its united
strength should be bent LO that task. I was very glad to see that Lord
Baldwin yesterday in the House of Lords said that he would mobilise
industry tomorrow. But I think it would have been much better if
Lord Baldwin had said that 2~ years ago, when everyone demanded a
Ministry of Supply. I ""Nill venture to say to hon. Gentlemen sitting
here behind the Government Bench, hon. Friends of mine, whom I
thank for the patience with which they have listened to what I have to say, that they have some responsibility for all this too, because, if
they had given one tithe of the cheers they have lavished upon this
transaction of Czechoslovakia to the small band of Members who
were endeavouring to get timely rearmament set in motion, we
should not now be in the position in which we are. Hon. Gentlemen
opposite, and hon. Members on the Liberal benches, are not entitled
to throw these stones. I remember for two years having to face, not
only the Government's deprecation, but their stern disapproval. Lord
Baldwin has now given the signal, tardy though it may be; let us at
least obey it.
After all, there are no secrets now about what happened in the air
and in the mobilisation of our anti-aircraft defences. These matters
have been, as my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the Abbey
Division said, seen by thousands of people. They can form their own
opinions of the character of the statements which have been
persistently made to us by Ministers on this subject. Who pretends
now that there is air parity with Germany? Who pretends now that
our anti-aircraft defences were adequately manned or armed? We
know that the German General Staff are well informed upon these
subjects, but the House of Commons has hitherto not taken seriously
its duty of requiring to assure itself on these matters. The Horne
Secretary [Sir Samuel Hoare] said the other night that he would
welcome investigation. Many things have been done which reflect the
greatest credit upon the administration. But the vital matters are
what we want to know about. I have asked again and again during
these three years for a secret Session where these matters could be
thrashed out, or for an investigation by a Select Committee of the
House, or for some other method. I ask now that, when we meet
again in the autumn, that should be a matter on which the
Government should take the House into its confidence, because we
have a right to know where we stand and what measures are being
taken to secure our position.
I do not grudge our loyal, brave people, who were ready to do
their duty no matter what the cost, who never flinched under the
strain of last week - I do not grudge them the natural, spontaneous
outburst of joy and relief when they learned that the hard ordeal
would no longer be required of them at the moment; but they should
know the truth. They should know that there has been gross neglect
and deficiency in our defences; they should know that we have
sustained a defeat without a war, the consequences of which will
travel far with us along our road; they should know that we have passed an awful milestone in our history, when the whole equilibrium of Europe has been deranged, and that the terrible words have
for the time being been pronounced against the Western democracies:
'Thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting.'
And do not suppose that this is the end. This is only the beginning of
the reckoning. This is only the first sip, the first foretaste of a bitter
cup which will be proffered to us year by year unless, by a supreme
recovery of moral health and martial vigour, we arise again and take
our stand for freedom as in the olden time. "
"The lights are going out', 16 October 1938, Broadcast to US, London",,"I avail myself with relief of the opportunity of speaking to the people of the United States. I do not know how long such liberties will be allowed. The stations of uncensored expression are closing down; the lights are going out; but there is still time for those to whom freedom and Parliamentary government mean something, to consult together. Let me, then, speak in truth and earnestness while time would also have been an opportunity for all the peace-loving and
moderate forces in Germany, together with the chiefs of the German
Army, to make a great effort to re-establish something like sane and
civilised conditions in their own country. If the risks of war which
were run by France and Britain at the last moment had been boldly
faced in good time, and plain declarations made, and meant, how
different would our prospects be today! ...
The culminating question to which I have been leading is whether
the world as we have known it - the great and hopeful world of
before the war, the world of increasing hope and enjoyment for the
common man, the world of honoured tradition and expanding
science - should meet this menace by submission or by resistance. Let
us see, then, whether the means of resistance remain to us today. We
have sustained an immense disaster; the renown of France is dimmed.
In spite of her brave, efficient army, her influence is profoundly
diminished. No one has a right to say that Britain, for all her
blundering, has broken her word - indeed, when it was too late, she
was better than her word. Nevertheless, Europe lies at this moment
abashed and distracted before the triumphant assertions of a
dictatorial power. In the Spanish Peninsula, a purely Spanish quarrel
has been carried by the intervention, or shall I say the 'nonintervention' (to quote the current jargon), of Dictators into the
region of a world cause. But it is not only in Europe that these
oppressions prevail. China is being torn to pieces by a military clique
in Japan; the poor, tormented Chinese people there are making a
brave and stubborn defence. The ancient empire of Ethiopia has been
overrun. The Ethiopians were taught to look to the sanctity of public
law, to the tribunal of many nations in majestic union. But all failed;
they were deceived, and now they are winning back their right to live
by beginning again from the bottom a struggle on primordial lines.
Even in South America the Nazi regime begins to undermine the
fabric of Brazilian societv.
Far away, happily protected by the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,
you, the people of the United States, to whom I now have the chance
to speak, are the spectators; and, I may add, the increasingly involved
spectators of these tragedies and crimes. We are left in no doubt
where American conviction and sympathies lie: but will you wait
until British freedom and independence have succumbed, and then
take up the cause when it is three-quarters ruined, yourselves alone? I
hear that they are saying in the United States that, because England
and France have failed to do their duty, therefore the American
people can wash their hands of the whole business. This may be the  remains. The American people have, it seems to me, formed a true passing mood of many people, but there is no sense in it. If things
have got much worse, all the more must we try to cope with them.
For, after all, survey the remaining forces of civilisation; they are
overwhelming. If only they were united in a common conception of
right and duty, there would be no war. On the contrary, the German
people, industrious and faithful, valiant, but alas! lacking in the
proper spirit of civic independence, liberated from their present
nightmare would take their honoured place in the vanguard of
human society. Alexander the Great remarked that the people of Asia
were slaves because they had not learned to pronounce the word
'No'. Let that not be the epitaph of the English-speaking peoples or
of Parliamentary democracy, or of France, or of the many surviving
Liberal states of Europe.
There, in one single word, is the resolve which the forces of
freedom and progress, of tolerance and goodwill, should take. It is
not in the power of one nation, however formidably armed, still less
is it in the power of a small group of men, violent, ruthless men, who
have always to cast '.:heir eyes back over their shoulders, to cramp
and fetter the forward march of human destiny. The preponderant
world forces are upon our side; they have but to be combined to be
obeyed. We must arm. Britain must arm. America must arm. If,
through an earnest desire for peace, we have placed ourselves at a
disadvantage, we must make up for it by redoubled exertions, and, if
necessary, by fortitude in suffering. We shall, no doubt, arm. Britain,
casting away the habits of centuries, will decree national service
upon her citizens. The British people will stand erect, and will face
whatever may be coming.
But arms - instrumentalities, as President Wilson called them - are
not sufficient by themselves. We must add to them the power of
ideas. People say we ought not to allow ourselves to be drawn into a
theoretical antagonism between Nazidom and democracy; but the
antagonism is here now. It is this very conflict of spiritual and moral
ideas which gives the free countries a great part of their strength. You
see these dictators on their pedestals, surrounded by the bayonets of
their soldiers and the truncheons of their police. On all sides they are
guarded by masses of armed men, cannons, aeroplanes, fortifications,
and the like - they boast and vaunt themselves before the world, yet
in their hearts there is unspoken fear. They are afraid of words and
thoughts: words spoken abroad, thoughts stirring at home - all the
more powerful because forbidden - terrify them. A little mouse of
thought appears in the room, and even the mightiest potentates are
thrown into panic. They make frantic efforts to bar out thoughts and  judgment upon the disaster which has befallen Europe. They realise, words; they are afraid of the workings of the human mind. Cannons,
aeroplanes, they can manufacture in large quantities; but how are
they to quell the natural promptings of human nature, which after all
these centuries of trial and progress has inherited a whole armoury of
potent and indestructible knowledge?
Dictatorship - the fetish worship of one man - is a passing phase.
A state of society where men may not speak their minds, where
children denounce their parents to the police, where a businessman
or small shopkeeper ruins his competitor by telling tales about his
private opinions - such a state of society cannot long endure if
brought into contact with the healthy outside world. The light of
civilised progress with its tolerances and co-operation, with its
dignities and joys, has often in the past been blotted out. But I hold
the belief that we have now at last got far enough ahead of barbarism
to control it, and to avert if, if only we realise what is afoot and make
up our minds in time. We shall do it in the end. But how much
harder our toil for every day's delay!
Is this a call to war? Does anyone pretend that preparation for
resistance to aggression is unleashing war? I declare it to be the sole
guarantee of peace. We need the swift gathering of forces to confront
not only military but moral aggression; the resolute and sober
acceptance of their duty by the English-speaking peoples and by all
the nations, great and small, who wish to walk with them. Their
faithful and zealous comradeship would almost between night and
morning clear the path of progress and banish from all our lives the
fear which already darkens the sunlight to hundreds of millions of
men. perhaps more clearly than the French and British publics have yet done, the far-reaching consequences of the abandonment and ruin of the Czechoslovak Republic. I hold to the conviction I expressed some months ago, that if in April, Mayor June, Great Britain, France and Russia had jointly declared that they would act together upon Nazi Germany if Herr Hitler committed an act of unprovoked aggression against this small state, and if they had told Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania what they meant to do in good time, and invited them to join the combination of peace-defending Powers, I hold that the German Dictator would have been confronted with such a formidable array that he would have been deterred from his purpose. This"
"'The bitter fruits of Munich', 14 March 1939, Waltham Abbey",,"Complaint has been made in some of the outlying parts of the Constituency of my speech on the Munich Agreement. In this I pointed out that a disaster of the first magnitude had befallen France and England. Is that not so? Why do you suppose we are making all these preparations? Why do you suppose that the French military service has been lengthened, and we have promised to send nineteen divisions to the Continent? It is because in the destruction of Czechoslovakia the entire balance of Europe was changed. The great and growing German Army is now free to turn in any direction: we do not know in what direction it will turn .... Many people at the time of the September crisis thought they were only giving away the interests of Czechoslovakia, but with every month that passes you will see that they were also giving away the interests of Britain, and the interests of peace and justice. Now I have defended this speech vv'hich has been attacked, and I say never did I make a truer statement to Parliament. Practically everything that I said has already proved true. And who are these people who go about saying that even if it were true, why state the facts? I reply, why mislead the nation? What is the use of Parliament if it is not the place where true statements can be brought before the people? What is the use of sending Members to the House of Commons who say just the popular things of the moment, and merely endeavour to give satisfaction to the Government Whips by cheering loudly every Ministerial platitude, and by walking through the Lobbies oblivious of the criticisms they hear? People talk about our Parliamentary institutions and Parliamentary democracy; but if these are to survive, it will not be because the Constituencies return tame, docile, subservient Members, and try to stamp out every form of independent judgment."
"'The surge of unity and of duty', 20 April 1939, Canada Club, London",,"Some foreigners mock at the British Empire because there are no parchment bonds or hard steel shackles which compel its united action. But there are other forces, far more subtle and far more compulsive to which the whole fabric spontaneously responds. These deep tides are flowing now. They sweep away in their flow differences of class and Party. They override the vast ocean spaces which separate the Dominions of the King. The electric telegraph is an old story; the wireless broadcast is a new one; but we rely on a process far more widespread and equally instantaneous. There are certain things which could happen, which it would not be necessary for us to argue about. No Constitutional issues would arise. Everyone, in the loneliest ranch, or in the most self-centred legislature, would see duty staring him in the face, and all hearts would have the same conviction. And not only the same conviction, but the same resolve to action .... One would underrate altogether the sentiment and repressed passion which unites the British Empire or Commonwealth, as many like to call it, by supposing that outworn Jingoism or grasping Imperialism play an important part. If we in this small island have gradually grown to a considerable estate, and have been able to give our wage-earners some relief from the harder forms of economic pressure, and to build up a decent, tolerant, compassionate, flexible, and infinitely varied society, it is because in all the great crises of our history the interest of Britain has marched with the progress and freedom of mankind. If in these hours of anxiety, but by no means of fear, we feel the surge of unity and of duty thrilling the pulses of the British race, it is because we are bound together by principles, themes and conceptions which make their appeal not only to the British Empire, but to the conscience and to the genius of humanity. It is refreshing to find that in the great American Republic these same resolves to resist at all costs the new machine-made forms of tyranny and oppression are also instinctive and strong. Canada has a great part to play in the relations of Great Britain and the United States. She spans the Atlantic Ocean with her loyalties; she clasps the American hand with her faith and goodwill. That long frontier from
the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans, guarded only by neighbourly
respect and honourable obligations, is an example to every country
and a pattern for the iuture of the world ....
We must not turn from the path of duty. If the British Empire is
fated to pass from life into history, we must hope it will not be by the
slow processes of dispersion and decay, but in some supreme
exertion for freedom, for right and for truth. Why is it that from so
many lands men look towards us today? It is certainly not because
we have gained advantages in a race of armaments, or have scored a
point by some deeply planned diplomatic intrigue, or because we
exhibit the blatancy and terrorism of ruthless power. It is because we
stand on the side of the general need. In the British Empire we not
only look out across the seas towards each other, but backwards to
our own history, to Magna Carta, to Habeas Corpus, to the
Petition of Right, to Trial by Jury, to the English Common Law and
to Parliamentary Democracy. These are the milestones and monuments that mark the path along which the British race has marched
to leadership and freedom. And over all this, uniting each Dominion
with the other and uniting us all with our majestic past, is the gold
circle of the Crown. What is within the circle? Not only the glory of
an ancient unconquered people, but the hope, the sure hope, of a
broadening life for hundreds of millions of men. "
"'Repudiation of the Balfour Declaration', 23 May 1939, House of Commons",,"Now I come to the gravamen of the case. I regret very much that the pledge of the Balfour Declaration, endorsed as it has been by successive Governments, and the conditions under which we obtained the Mandate, have both been violated by the Government's proposals. There is much in this White Paper which is alien to the spirit of the Balfour Declaration, but I will not trouble about that. I select the one point upon which there is plainly a breach and repudiation of the Balfour Declaration - the provision that Jewish immigration can be stopped in five years' time by the decision of an Arab majority. That is a plain breach of a solemn obligation. I am
astonished that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, of all
others, and at this moment above all others, should have lent himself
to this new and sudden default.
To whom was the pledge of the Balfour Declaration made? It was
not made to the Jews of Palestine, it was not made to those who were
actually living in Palestine. It was made to world Jewry and in
particular to the Zionist associations. It was in consequence of and
on the basis of this pledge that we received important help in the
war, and that after the war we received from the Allied and
Associated Powers the Mandate for Palestine. This pledge of a home
of refuge, or an asylum, was not made to the Jews in Palestine but to
the Jews outside Palestine, to that vast, unhappy mass of scattered,
persecuted, wandering Jews whose intense, unchanging, unconquerable desire has been for a National Home - to quote the words to
which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister subscribed in the
Memorial which he and others sent to us:
the Jewish people who have through centuries of dispersion and
persecution patiently awaited the hour of its restoration to its
ancestral home.
Those are the words. They were the people outside, not the people in.
It is not with the Jews in Palestine that we have now or at any future
time to deal, but with world Jewry, with Jews all over the world.
That is the pledge which was given, and that is the pledge which we
are now asked to break, for how can this pledge be kept, I want to
know, if in five years' time the National Home is to be barred and no
more Jews are to be allowed in without the permission of the Arabs?
I entirely accept the distinction between making a Jewish National
Home in Palestine and making Palestine a Jewish National Home. I
think I was one of the first to draw that distinction. The Government
quote me, and they seem to associate me with them on this subject in
their White Paper, but what sort of National Home is offered to the
Jews of the world when we are asked to declare that in five years'
time the door of that home is to be shut and barred in their faces?
The idea of home to wanderers is, surely, a place to which they can
resort. When grievous and painful words like 'breach of pledge',
'repudiation' and 'default' are used in respect of the public action of
men and Ministers who in private life observe a stainless honour -
the country must discuss these matters as they present themselves in
their public aspect - it is necessary to be precise, and to do them justice His Majesty's Government have been brutally precise. On
page 11 of the White Paper, in sub-section (3) of paragraph 14 there
is this provision:
After the period of five years no further Jewish immigration will be
permitted unless the Arabs of Palestine are prepared to acquiesce in it.
Now, there is the breach; there is the violation of the pledge; there is
the abandonment of the Balfour Declaration; there is the end of the
vision, of the hope, of the dream. If you leave out those words this
White Paper is no more than one of the several experiments and
essays in Palestinian constitution-making which we have had of
recent years, but put in those three lines and there is the crux, the
peccant point, the breach, and we must have an answer to it ....
I cannot feel that we have accorded to the Arab race unfair
treatment after the support which they gave us in the late war. The
Palestinian Arabs, of course, were for the most part fighting against
us, but elsewhere o'/er vast regions inhabited by the Arabs independent Arab Kingdoms and principalities have come into being such as
had never been known in Arab history before. Some have been
established by Great Britain and others by France. When I wrote this
despatch in 1922 I was advised by, among others, Colonel Lawrence,
the truest champion of Arab rights whom modern times have known.
He has recorded his opinion that the settlement was fair and just -
his definite, settled opinion. Together we placed the Emir Abdullah in
Transjordania, where he remains faithful and prosperous to this day.
Together, under the responsibility of the Prime Minister of those
days, King Feisal was placed upon the throne of Iraq, where his
descendants now rule. But we also showed ourselves continually
resolved to close no door upon the ultimate development of a Jewish
National Home, fed by continual Jewish immigration into Palestine.
Colonel Lawrence thought this was fair then. Why should it be
pretended that it is unfair now? ...
I end upon the land of Palestine. It is strange indeed that we should
turn away from our task in Palestine at the moment when, as the
Secretary of State told us yesterday, the local disorders have been
largely mastered. It is stranger still that we should turn away when
the great experiment and bright dream, the historic dream, has
proved its power to succeed. Yesterday the Minister responsible
descanted eloquently in glowing passages upon the magnificent work
which the Jewish colonists have done. They have made the desert
bloom. They have started a score of thriving industries, he said. They have founded a great city on the barren shore. They have harnessed
the Jordan and spread its electricity throughout the land. So far from
being persecuted, the Arabs have crowded into the country and
multiplied till their population has increased more than even all
world Jewry could lift up the Jewish population. Now we are asked
to decree that all this is to stop and all this is to come to an end. We
are now asked to submit - and this is what rankles most with me - to
an agitation which is fed with foreign money and ceaselessly inflamed
by Nazi and by fascist propaganda.
It is 20 years ago since my right hon. Friend used these stirring
words:
A great responsibility will rest upon the Zionists, who, before long,
will be proceeding, with joy in their hearts, to the ancient seat of their
people. Theirs will be the task to build up a new prosperity and a new
civilisation in old Palestine, so long neglected and mis-ruled.
Well, they have answe!""ed his Lall. They have fulfilled his hopes. How
can he find it in his heart to strike them this mortal blow?"
"'A hush over Europe', 8 August 1939, Broadcast to US, London",,"There is a hush over all Europe, nay, over all the world, broken only by the dull thud of Japanese bombs falling on Chinese cities, on Chinese Universities or near British and American ships. But then, China is a long way off, so why worry? The Chinese are fighting for what the founders of the American Constitution in their stately language called: 'Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.' And they seem to be fighting very well. Many good judges think they are going to win. Anyhow, let's wish them luck! Let's give them a wave of encouragement - as your President did last week, when he gave notice about ending the commercial treaty. After all, the suffering Chinese are fighting our battle - the battle of democracy. They are
defending the soil, the good earth, that has been theirs since the dawn
of time against cruel and unprovoked aggression. Give them a cheer
across the ocean - no one knows whose turn it may be next. If this
habit of military dictatorships' breaking into other people's lands
with bomb and shell and bullet, stealing the property and killing the
proprietors, spreads too widely, we may none of us be able to think
of summer holidays for quite a while.
But to come back to the hush I said was hanging over Europe.
What kind of a hush is it? Alas! it is the hush of suspense, and in
many lands it is the hush of fear. Listen! No, listen carefully; I think I
hear something - yes, there it was quite clear. Don't you hear it? It is
the tramp of armies crunching the gravel of the parade-grounds,
splashing through rain-soaked fields, the tramp of two million
German soldiers and more than a million Italians - 'going on
manoeuvres' - yes, only on manoeuvres! Of course it's only
manoeuvres - just like last year. After all, the Dictators must train
their soldiers. They could scarcely do less in common prudence,
when the Danes, the Dutch, the Swiss, the Albanians - and of course
the Jews - may leap out upon them at any moment and rob them of
their living-space, and make them sign another paper to say who
began it. Besides, these German and Italian armies may have another
work of Liberation to perform. It was only last year they liberated
Austria from the horrors of self-government. It was only in March
they freed the Czechoslovak Republic from the misery of independent existence. It is only two years ago that Signor Mussolini gave the
ancient kingdom of Abyssinia its Magna Carta. It is only two months
ago that little Albania got its writ of Habeas Corpus, and Mussolini
sent in his Bill of Rights for King Zog to pay. Why, even at this
moment, the mountaineers of the Tyrol, a German-speaking population who have dwelt in their beautiful valleys for a thousand years,
are being liberated, that is to say, uprooted, from the land they love,
from the soil which Andreas Hofer died to defend. No wonder the
armies are tramping on when there is so much liberation to be done,
and no wonder there is a hush among all the neighbours of Germany
and Italy while they are wondering which one is going to be
'liberated' next.
The Nazis say that they are being encircled. They have encircled
themselves with a ring of neighbours who have to keep on guessing
who will be struck down next. This kind of guesswork is a very tiring
game. Countries, especially small countries, have long ceased to find
it amusing. Can you wonder that the neighbours of Germany, both great and small, have begun to think of stopping the game, by simply
saying to the Nazis on the principle of the Covenant of the League of
Nations: 'He who attacks any, attacks all. He who attacks the
weakest will find he has attacked the strongest'? That is how we are
spending our holiday over here, in poor weather, in a lot of clouds.
We hope it is better with you.
One thing has struck me as very strange, and that is the resurgence
of the one-man power after all these centuries of experience and
progress. It is curious how the English-speaking peoples have always
had this horror of one-man power. They are quite ready to follow a
leader for a time, as long as he is serviceable to them; but the idea of
handing themselves over, lock, stock and barrel, body and soul, to
one man, and worshipping him as if he were an idol - that has
always been odious to the whole theme and nature of our
civilisation. The architects of the American Constitution were as
careful as those who shaped the British Constitution to guard against
the whole life and fortunes, and all the laws and freedom of the
nation, being placed in the hands of a tyrant. Checks and counterchecks in the body politic, large devolutions of State government,
instruments and processes of free debate, frequent recurrence to first
principles, the right of opposition to the most powerful governments,
and above all ceaseless vigilance, have preserved, and will preserve,
the broad characteristics of British and American institutions. But in
Germany, on a mountain peak, there sits one man who in a single
day can release the world from the fear which now oppresses it; or in
a single day can plunge all that we have and are into a volcano of
smoke and flame.
If Herr Hitler does not make war, there will be no war. No one else
is going to make war. Britain and France are determined to shed no
blood except in self-defence or in defence of their Allies. No one has
ever dreamed of attacking Germany. If Germany desires to be
reassured against attack by her neighbours, she has only to say the
word and we will give her the fullest guarantees in accordance with
the principles of the Covenant of the League. We have said
repeatedly we ask nothing for ourselves in the way of security that
we are not willing freely to share with the German people. Therefore,
if war should come there can be no doubt upon whose head the
blood-guiltiness will fall. Thus lies the great issue at this moment,
and none can tell how it will be settled.
It is not, believe me, my American friends, from any ignoble
shrinking from pain and death that the British and French peoples
pray for peace. It is not because we have any doubts how a struggle between Nazi Germany and the civilised world would ultimately end
that we pray tonight and every night for peace. But whether it be
peace or war - peace with its broadening and brightening prosperity,
now within our reach, or war with its measureless carnage and
destruction - we must strive to frame some system of human
relations in the future which will bring to an end this prolonged
hideous uncertainty, which will let the working and creative forces of
the world get on with their job, and which will no longer leave the
whole life of mankind dependent upon the virtues, the caprice, or the
wickedness of a single man. On the very day that Britain and France declared war on Nazi
Germany, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain invited Churchill to
resume his old post at the Admiralty. Then, after more than six
months of so-called 'phoney' war, Hitler launched his blitzkrieg
against Belgium, France and the Low Countries. In that same hour of
peril, the British people turned for salvation to the man whose
warnings they had failed to heed.
Churchill saw it as his prime task to keep the flag of Freedom
flying until the 'Great Republic across the Seas' (a favourite
Churchillian phrase), awoke from her slumbers. Convinced, against
all the odds, that Britain could hold out against Hitler in her island
fastness, he was sufficient of a realist to know that only the combined
strength of the English-speaking world could in the end defeat Nazi
Germany and liberate the enslaved nations of Europe. He held to a
fond belief that President Roosevelt would seize any opportunity to
join the fray, but it was to take the Japanese attack on the American
Fleet at Pearl Harbor - more than 18 months later, in December
1941 - before his hopes became reality.
Churchill then played a key role in persuading the United States to
give priority to the defeat of Germany, before getting to grips with
Japan. Thus, together with President Roosevelt, he led the free world
to victory. "
"War, 3 September 1939, House of Commons",,"In this solemn hour it is a consolation to recall and to dwell upon our repeated efforts for peace. All have been ill-starred, but all have been faithful and sincere. This IS of the highest moral value - and not only moral value, but practical value - at the present time, because the wholehearted concurrence of scores of millions of men and women, whose co-operation is indispensable and whose comradeship and brotherhood are indispensable, is the only foundation upon which the trial and tribulation of modern war can be endured and surmounted. This moral conviction alone affords that ever-fresh resilience which renews the strength and energy of people in long, doubtful and dark days. Outside, the storms of war may blow and the lands may be lashed with the fury of its gales, but in our own hearts this Sunday morning there is peace. Our hands may be active,
but our consciences are at rest.
We must not underrate the gravity of the task which lies before us
or the temerity of the ordeal, to which we shall not be found
unequal. We must expect many disappointments, and many unpleasant surprises, but we may be sure that the task which we have freely
accepted is one not beyond the compass and the strength of the
British Empire and the French Republic. The Prime Minister said it
was a sad day, and that is indeed true, but at the present time there is
another note which may be present, and that is a feeling of
thankfulness that, if these great trials were to come upon our Island,
there is a generation of Britons here now ready to prove itself not
unworthy of the days of yore and not unworthy of those great men,
the fathers of our land, who laid the foundations of our laws and
shaped the greatness of our country.
This is not a question of fighting for Danzig or fighting for Poland.
We are fighting to save the whole world from the pestilence of Nazi
tyranny and in defence of all that is most sacred to man. This is no
war of domination or imperial aggrandizement or material gain; no
war to shut any country out of its sunlight and means of progress. It
is a war, viewed in its inherent quality, to establish, on impregnable
rocks, the rights of the individual, and it is a war to establish and
revive the stature of man. Perhaps it might seem a paradox that a
war undertaken in the name of liberty and right should require, as a
necessary part of its processes, the surrender for the time being of so
many of the dearly valued liberties and rights. In these last few days
the House of Commons has been voting dozens of Bills which hand
over to the executive our most dearly valued traditional liberties. We
are sure that these liberties will be in hands which will not abuse
them, which will use them for no class or party interests, which will
cherish and guard them, and we look forward to the day, surely and
confidently we look forward to the day, when our liberties and rights
will be restored to us, and when we shall be able to share them with
the peoples to whom such blessings are unknown. "
"Russia: 'A riddle; wrapped in a mystery', 1 October 1939,
Broadcast, London",,"The British Empire and the French Republic have been at war with
Nazi Germany for a month tonight. We have not yet come at all to
the severity of fighting which is to be expected; but three important
things have happened.
First, Poland has bf'en again overrun by two of the great Powers
which held her in bondage for 150 years, but were unable to quench
the spirit of the Polish nation. The heroic defence of Warsaw shows
that the soul of Poland is indestructible, and that she will rise again
like a rock, which may for a spell be submerged by a tidal wave, but
which remains a rock.
What is the second event of this first month? It is, of course, the
assertion of the power of Russia. Russia has pursued a cold policy of
self-interest. We could have wished that the Russian armies should be
standing on their present line as the friends and allies of Poland
instead of as invaders. But that the Russian armies should stand on
this line was clearly necessary for the safety of Russia against the
Nazi menace. At any rate, the line is there, and an Eastern Front has
been created which Nazi Germany does not dare assail. When Herr
von Ribbentrop was summoned to Moscow last week, it was to learn
the fact, and to accept the fact, that the Nazi designs upon the Baltic
States and upon the Ukraine must come to a dead stop.
I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle,
wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma; but perhaps there is a key.
That key is Russian national interest. It cannot be in accordance with
the interest or the safety of Russia that Germany should plant itself
upon the shores of the Black Sea, or that it should overrun the
Balkan States and subjugate the Slavonic peoples of south-eastern
Europe. That would be contrary to the historic life-interest of Russia.
But in this quarter of the world - the south-east of Europe - these interests of Russia fall into the same channel as the interests of
Britain and France. None of these three Powers can afford to see
Rumania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and above all Turkey, put under the
German heel. Through the fog of confusion and uncertainty we may
discern quite plainly the community of interests which exists between
England, France and Russia - a community of interests to prevent the
Nazis carrying the flames of war into the Balkans and Turkey. Thus,
my friends, at some risk of being proved wrong by events, I will
proclaim tonight my conviction that the second great fact of the first
month of the war is that Hitler, and all that Hitler stands for, have
been and are being warned off the east and the south-east of Europe.
What is the third event? Here I speak as First Lord of the
Admiralty, with especial caution. It would seem that the V-boat
attack upon the life of the British Isles has not so far proved
successful. It is true that when they sprang out upon us and we were
going about our ordinary business, with two thousand ships in
constant movement every day upon the seas, they managed to do
some serious damage. ""But the Royal Navy has immediately attacked
the V-boats, and is hunting them night and day - I will not say
without mercy, because God forbid we should ever part company
with that - but at any rate with zeal and not altogether without
relish. And it looks tonight very much as if it is the V-boats who are
feeling the weather, and not the Royal Navy or the world-wide
commerce of Britain. A week has passed since a British ship, alone or
in convoy, has been sunk or even molested by a V-boat on the high
seas; and during the first month of the war we have captured by our
efficient contraband control 150,000 tons more German merchandise - food, oil, minerals and other commodities - for our own
benefit than we have lost by all the V-boat sinkings put together. In
fact, up to date - please observe I make no promises (we must deal in
performance and not in promises) - up to date we have actually got
150,000 tons of very desirable supplies into this Island more than we
should have got if war had not been declared, and if no V-boat had
ever cast sailormen to their fate upon the stormy seas. This seems to
be a very solid, tangible fact which has emerged from the first month
of the war against Nazidom.
Of course, we are told that all the V-boats have gone home just to
tell their master about their exploits and their experiences. But that is
not true, because every day we are attacking them upon the
approaches to the British Isles. Some undoubtedly have preferred to
go off and sink the unprotected neutral ships of Norway and
Sweden. I hope the day will come when the Admiralty will be able to invite the ships of all nations to join the British convoys, and to
insure them on their voyages at a reasonable rate. We must, of
course, expect that the U-boat attack upon the seaborne commerce
of the world will be renewed presently on a greater scale. We hope,
however, that by the end of October we shall have three times as
many hunting-craft at work as we had at the beginning of the war;
and we hope that by the measures we have taken, our means of
putting down this pest will grow continually. I can assure you we are
taking great care about all that.
Therefore, to sum up the results of the first month, let us say that
Poland has been overrun, but will rise again; that Russia has warned
Hitler off his Eastern dreams; and that U-boats may be safely left to
the care and constant attention of the British Navy. "
"'The Navy's here!', 23 February 1940, Guildhall, London",,"My colleagues of the Board of Admiralty and of the War Cabinet are grateful to you for inviting us here today to share the hospitality which the City of London has extended to the victors of the River Plate. It is an occasion at once joyous, memorable and unique. It is the highest compliment your ancient Corporation could give to the officers and men of the Exeter and Ajax and through them to the whole of our Navy, upon whom, under Providence, our lives and State depend from hour to hour. I do not suppose that the bonds which unite the British Navy to the British nation - and they have taken a long time to form - or those which join the Navy and the Mercantile Marine were ever so strong as they are today. The brunt of the war so far has fallen upon the sailormen, and their comrades in the Coastal Air Force, and we
have already lost nearly 3,000 lives in a hard, unrelenting struggle
which goes on night and day and is going on now without a
moment's respite. The brilliant sea fight which Admiral Harwood
conceived, and which those who are here executed, takes its place in
our naval annals, and I might add that in a dark, cold winter it
warmed the cockles of the British heart. But it is not only in those few
glittering, deadly hours of action, which rivet all eyes, that the strain
falls upon the Navy. Far more does it fall in the weeks and months of
ceaseless trial and vigilance on cold, dark, stormy seas from whose
waves at any moment death and destruction may leap with sullen
roar. There is the task which these men were discharging and which
their comrades are discharging. There was the task from which, in a
sense, the fierce action was almost a relief.
Here let me say a word for the naval members of the Board of
Admiralty and especially for the First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound,
and his Deputy-Chief of Naval Staff [the newly promoted ViceAdmiral Phillips] for the skilful combination for which they have
been responsible. You must remember that for one stroke that goes
home, for one clutch that grips the raider, there are many that miss
their mark on the broad oceans; for every success there are many
disappointments. You must never forget that the dangers that are
seen are only a small part of those that are warded off by care and
foresight, and therefore pass unnoticed. The Admiralty and the Fleet
are learning together the special conditions of this hard and novel
war; and, although mistakes and accidents will certainly occur, and
sorrow will fall from time to time upon us, we hope that from
Whitehall the sense of resolution and design at the centre will impart
itself to all afloat, and will lighten the burden of their task and
concert the vigour of their action. It is not, for instance, a mere
coincidence that has brought the Achilles out of the vast Pacific
Ocean to the shores of far-off New Zealand, in order to receive in the
Antipodes the same warm-hearted welcome as her sisters the Ajax
and the Exeter are receiving now in dear old London.
The spirit of all our forces serving on salt water has never been
more strong and high than now. The warrior heroes of the past may
look down, as Nelson's monument looks down upon us now,
without any feeling that the island race has lost its daring or that the
examples they set in bygone centuries have faded as the generations
have succeeded one another. It was not for nothing that Admiral
Harwood, as he instantly at full speed attacked an enemy which
might have sunk anyone of his ships by a single successful salvo from its far heavier guns, flew Nelson's immortal signal, of which
neither the new occasion, nor the conduct of all ranks and ratings.
nor the final result were found unworthy.
To the glorious tale of the action off the Plate there has recently
been added an epilogue - the rescue last week by the Cossack and her
flotilla, under the nose of the enemy and amid the tangles of onesided neutrality, of the British captives taken from the sunken
German raider. Their rescue at the very moment when these unhappy
men were about to be delivered over to German bondage proves that
the long arm of British sea power can be stretched out, not only for
foes but also for faithful friends. And to Nelson's signal of 135 years
ago, 'England expects that every man will do his duty,' there may
now be added last week's no less proud reply: 'The Navy is here!' "
"Blood; toil; tears and sweat', 13 May 1940, House of Commons",,"I beg to move, That this House welcomes the formation of a Government representing the united and inflexible resolve of the nation to prosecute the war with Germany to a victorious conclusion. On Friday evening last I received His Majesty's Commission to form a new Administration. It was the evident wish and will of Parliament and the nation that this should be conceived on the broadest possible basis and that it should include all parties, both those who supported the late Government and also the parties of the Opposition. I have completed the most important part of this task. A War Cabinet has been formed of five Members, representing, with the Opposition Liberals, the unity of the nation. The three party Leaders have agreed to serve, either in the War Cabinet or in high executive office. The three Fighting Services have been filled. It was necessary that this should be done in one single day, on account of the extreme urgency and rigour of events. A number of other positions, key positions, were filled yesterday, and I am submitting a further list to His Majesty tonight. I hope to complete the appointment of the principal Ministers during tomorrow. The appointment of the other Ministers usually takes a little longer, but I trust that, when Parliament meets again, this part of my task will be completed, and that the administration will be complete in all respects. I considered it in the public interest to suggest that the House should be summoned to meet today. Mr Speaker agreed, and took the necessary steps, in accordance with the powers conferred upon him by the Resolution of the House. At the end of the proceedings today, the Adjournment of the House will be proposed until Tuesday, 21st May, with, of course, provision for earlier meeting, if need be. The business to be considered during that week will be notified to Members at the earliest opportunity. I now invite the House, by the Motion which stands in my name, to record its approval of the steps taken and to declare its confidence in the new Government. To form an Administration of this scale and complexity is a
serious undertaking in itself, but it must be remembered that we are
in the preliminary stage of one of the greatest battles in history, that
we are in action at many other points in Norway and in Holland,
that we have to be prepared in the Mediterranean, that the air battle
is continuous and that many preparations, such as have been
indicated by my hon. Friend below the Gangway, have to be made
here at home. In this crisis I hope I may be pardoned if I do not
address the House at any length today. I hope that any of my friends
and colleagues, or former colleagues, who are affected by the
political reconstruction, will make allowance, all allowance, for any
lack of ceremony with which it has been necessary to act. I would say
to the House, as I said to those who have joined this Government: 'I
have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.'
We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have
before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You
ask, what is our policy? I can say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and
air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us;
to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the
dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You
ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: It is victory, victory
at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and
hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival. Let
that be realised; no survival for the British Empire, no survival for all
that the British Empire has stood for, no survival for the urge and
impulse of the ages, that mankind will move forward towards its
goal. But I take up my task with buoyancy and hope. I feel sure that
our cause will not be suffered to fail among men. At this time I feel
entitled to claim the aid of all, and I say, 'Come then, let us go
forward together with our united strength.' "
"Arm yourselves; and be ye men of valour!', 19 May 1940, Broadcast, London",,"I speak to you for the first time as Prime Minister in a solemn hour
for the life of our country, of our Empire, of our Allies, and, above
all, of the cause of Freedom. A tremendous battle is raging in France
and Flanders. The Germans, by a remarkable combination of air
bombing and heavily armoured tanks, have broken through the
French defences Gorth of the Maginot Line, and strong columns of
their armoured vehicles are ravaging the open country, which for the
first day or two was without defenders. They have penetrated deeply
and spread alarm and confusion in their track. Behind them there are
now appearing infantry in lorries, and behind them, again, the large
masses are moving forward. The re-groupment of the French armies
to make head against, and also to strike at, this intruding wedge has
been proceeding for several days, largely assisted by the magnificent
efforts of the Royal Air Force.
We must not allow ourselves to be intimidated by the presence of
these armoured vehicles in unexpected places behind our lines. If they
are behind our Front, the French are also at many points fighting
actively behind theirs. Both sides are therefore in an extremely
dangerous position. And if the French Army, and our own Army, are
well handled, as I believe they will be; if the French retain that genius
for recovery and counter-attack for which they have so long been
famous; and if the British Army shows the dogged endurance and
solid fighting power of which there have been so many examples in
the past - then a sudden transformation of the scene might spring
into being.
It would be foolish, however, to disguise the gravity of the hour. It
would be still more foolish to lose heart and courage or to suppose
that well-trained, well-equipped armies numbering three or four
millions of men can be overcome in the space of a few weeks, or even
months, by a scoop, or raid of mechanised vehicles, however
formidable. We may look with confidence to the stabilisation of the
Front in France, and to the general engagement of the masses, which
will enable the qualities of the French and British soldiers to be
matched squarely against those of their adversaries. For myself, I have invincible confidence in the French Army and its leaders. Only a
very small part of that splendid Army has yet been heavily engaged;
and only a very small part of France has yet been invaded. There is
good evidence to show that practically the whole of the specialised
and mechanised forces of the enemy have been already thrown into
the battle; and we know that very heavy losses have been inflicted
upon them. No officer or man, no brigade or division, which
grapples at close quarters with the enemy, wherever encountered,
can fail to make a worthy contribution to the general result. The
Armies must cast away the idea of resisting behind concrete lines
or natural obstacles, and must realise that mastery can only be
regained by furious and unrelenting assault. And this spirit must
not only animate the High Command, but must inspire every fighting
man.
In the air - often at serious odds, often at odds hitherto thought
overwhelming - we have been clawing down three or four to one of
our enemies; and the relative balance of the British and German Air
Forces is now considerably more favourable to us than at the
beginning of the battle. In cutting down the German bombers we are
fighting our own battle as well as that of France. My confidence in
our ability to fight it out to the finish with the German Air Force has
been strengthened by the fierce encounters which have taken place
and are taking place. At the same time, our heavy bombers are
striking nightly at the tap-root of German mechanised power, and
have already inflicted serious damage upon the oil refineries on which
the Nazi effort to dominate the world directly depends.
We must expect that as soon as stability is reached on the Western
Front, the bulk of that hideous apparatus of aggression which gashed
Holland into ruin and slavery in a few days will be turned upon us. I
am sure I speak for all when I say we are ready to face it; to endure it;
and to retaliate against it - to any extent that the unwritten laws of
war permit. There will be many men and many women in this Island
who when the ordeal comes upon them, as come it will, will feel
comfort, and even a pride, that they are sharing the perils of our lads
at the Front - soldiers, sailors and airmen, God bless them - and are
drawing away from them a part at least of the onslaught they have to
bear. Is not this the appointed time for all to make the utmost
exertions in their power? If the battle is to be won, we must provide
our men with ever-increasing quantities of the weapons and
ammunition they need. We must have, and have quickly, more
aeroplanes, more tanks, more shells, more guns. There is imperious
need for these vital munitions. They increase our strength against the powerfully armed enemy. They replace the wastage of the obstinate
struggle; and the knowledge that wastage will speedily be replaced
enables as to draw more readily upon our reserves and throw them in
now that everything counts so much.
Our task is not only to win the battle - but to win the war. After
this battle in France abates its force, there will come the battle for our
Island - for all that Britain is, and all that Britain means. That will be
the struggle. In that supreme emergency we shall not hesitate to take
every step, even the most drastic, to call forth from our people the
last ounce and the last inch of effort of which they are capable. The
interests of property, the hours of labour, are nothing compared with
the struggle of life and honour, for right and freedom, to which we
have vowed ourselves.
I have received [rom the Chiefs of the French Republic, and in
particular from its indomitable Prime Minister, M. Reynaud, the
most sacred pledges that whatever happens they will fight to the end,
be it bitter or be it glorious. Nay, if we fight to the end, it can only be
glorious.
Having received His Majesty's commission, I have formed an
Administration of men and women of every Party and of almost
every point of view. We have differed and quarrelled in the past; but
now one bond unites us all - to wage war until victory is won, and
never to surrender ourselves to servitude and shame, whatever the
cost and the agony may be. This is one of the most awe-striking
periods in the long history of France and Britain. It is also beyond
doubt the most sublime. Side by side, unaided except by their kith
and kin in the great Dominions and by the wide Empires which rest
beneath their shield - side by side, the British and French peoples
have advanced to rescue not only Europe but mankind from the
foulest and most soul-destroying tyranny which has ever darkened
and stained the pages of history. Behind them - behind us - behind
the Armies and Fleets of Britain and France - gather a group of
shattered States and bludgeoned races: the Czechs, the Poles, the
Norwegians, the Danes, the Dutch, the Belgians - upon all of whom
the long night of barbarism will descend, unbroken even by a star of
hope, unless we conquer, as conquer we must; as conquer we shall.
Today is Trinity Sunday. Centuries ago words were written to be a
call and a spur to the faithful servants of Truth and Justice: 'Arm
yourselves, and be ye men of valour, and be in readiness for the
conflict; for it is better for us to perish in battle than to look upon the
outrage of our nation and our altar. As the Will of God is in Heaven,
even so let it be.' "
"'Wars are not won by evacuations', 4 June 1940, House of Commons",,"From the moment that the French defences at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken at the end of the second week of May, only a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and French Armies who had entered Belgium at the appeal of the Belgian King; but this strategic fact was not immediately realised. The French High Command hoped they would be able to close the gap, and the Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have involved almost certainly the destruction of the fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the abandonment of the whole of Belgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German penetration were realised and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed command in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a newly created French Army which was to have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it. However, the Germ:1n eruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of the north. Eight or nine armoured divisions, each of about four hundred armoured vehicles of different kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and divisible into
small self-contained units, cut off all communications between us and
the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for
food and ammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards
through Abbeville, and it shore its way up the coast to Boulogne and
Calais, and almost to Dnnkirk. Behind this armoured and mechanised onslaught carne a number of German divisions in lorries, and
behind them again there plodded comparatively slowly the dull brute
mass of the ordinary German Army and German people, always so
ready to be led to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and
comforts which they have never known in their own.
I have said this armoured scythe-stroke almost reached Dunkirkalmost but not quite. Boulogne and Calais were the scenes of
desperate fighting. The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and
were then withdrawn by orders from this country. The Rifle Brigade,
the 60th Rifles, and the Queen Victoria's Rifles, with a battalion of
British tanks and 1,000 Frenchmen, in all about four thousand
strong, defended Calais to the last. The British Brigadier was given
an hour to surrender. He spurned the offer, and four days of intense
street fighting passed before silence reigned over Calais, which
marked the end of a memorable resistance. Only 30 unwounded
survivors were brought off by the Navy, and we do not know the fate
of their comrades. Their sacrifice, however, was not in vain. At least
two armoured divisions, which otherwise would have been turned
against the British Expeditionary Force, had to be sent to overcome
them. They have added another page to the glories of the light
division, and the time gained enabled the Gravelines waterlines to be
flooded and to be held by the French troops.
Thus it was that the port of Dunkirk was kept open. When it was
found impossible for the Armies of the north to reopen their
communications to Amiens with the main French Armies, only one
choice remained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn. The Belgian, British and
French Armies were almost surrounded. Their sole line of retreat was
to a single port and to its neighbouring beaches. They were pressed
on every side by heavy attacks and far outnumbered in the air.
When, a week ago today, I asked the House to fix this afternoon as
the occasion for a statement, I feared it would be my hard lot to
announce the greatest military disaster in our long history. I thought
- and some good judges agreed with me - that perhaps 20,000 or
30,000 men might be re-embarked. But it certainly seemed that the
whole of the French First Army and the whole of the British Expeditionary Force north of the Amiens-Abbeville gap would be
broken up in the open field or else would have to capitulate for lack
of food and ammunition. These were the hard and heavy tidings for
which I called upon the House and the nation to prepare themselves
a week ago. The whole root and core and brain of the British Army.
on which and around which we were to build, and are to build, the
great British Armies in the later years of the war, seemed about to
perish upon the field or to be led into an ignominious and starving
captivity.
That was the prospect a week ago. But another blow which might
well have proved final was yet to fall upon us. The King of the
Belgians had called upon us to come to his aid. Had not this Ruler
and his Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued
their country from extinction in the late war, and had they nor
sought refuge in what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French
and British Armies might well at the outset have saved not only
Belgium but perhaps even Poland. Yet at the last moment, when
Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called upon us to come
to his aid, and even at the last moment we came. He and his brave,
efficient Army, nearly half a million strong, guarded our left flank
and thus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly,
without prior consultation, with the least possible notice, without the
advice of his Ministers and upon his own personal act, he sent a
plenipotentiary to the German Command, surrendered his Army,
and exposed our whole flank and means of retreat.
I asked the House a week ago to suspend its judgment because the
facts were not clear, but I do not feel that any reason now exists why
we should not form our own opinions upon this pitiful episode. The
surrender of the Belgian Army compelled the British at the shortest
notice to cover a flank to the sea more than 30 miles in length.
Otherwise all would have been cut off, and all would have shared the
fate to which King Leopold had condemned the finest Army his
country had ever formed. So in doing this and in exposing this flank,
as anyone who followed the operations on the map will see, contact
was lost between the British and two out of the three corps forming
the First French Army, who were still farther from the coast than we
were, and it seemed impossible that any large number of Allied
troops could reach the coast.
The enemy attacked on all sides with great strength and fierceness,
and their main power, the power of their far more numerous Air
Force, was thrown into the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk and the beaches. Pressing in upon the narrow exit, both from the east
and from the west, the enemy began to fire with cannon upon the
beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or depart. They
sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas; they sent repeated
waves of hostile aircraft, sometimes more than a hundred strong in
one formation, to Celst their bombs upon the single pier that
remained, and upon the sand dunes upon which the troops had their
eyes for shelter. Their V-boats, one of which was sunk, and their
motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic which now began.
For four or five days an intense struggle reigned. All their armoured
divisions - or what was left of them - together with great masses of
infantry and artillery, hurled themselves in vain upon the evernarrowing, ever-contracting appendix within which the British and
French Armies fought.
Meanwhile, the Royal Navy, with the willing help of countless
merchant seamen, strained every nerve to embark the British and
Allied troops; 220 light warships and 650 other vessels were
engaged. They had to operate upon the difficult coast, often in
adverse weather, under an almost ceaseless hail of bombs and an
increasing concentration of artillery fire. Nor were the seas, as I have
said, themselves free from mines and torpedoes. It was in conditions
such as these that our men carried on, with little or no rest, for days
and nights on end, making trip after trip across the dangerous
waters, bringing with them always men whom they had rescued. The
numbers they have brought back are the measure of their devotion
and their courage. The hospital ships, which brought off many
thousands of British and French wounded, being so plainly marked
were a special target for Nazi bombs; but the men and women on
board them never faltered in their duty.
Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force, which had already been
intervening in the battle, so far as its range would allow, from home
bases, now used part of its main metropolitan fighter strength, and
struck at the German bombers and at the fighters which in large
numbers protected them. This struggle was protracted and fierce.
Suddenly the scene has cleared, the crash and thunder has for the
moment - but only for the moment - died away. A miracle of
deliverance, achieved by valour, by perseverance, by perfect discipline, by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable
fidelity, is manifest to us all. The enemy was hurled back by the
retreating British and French troops. He was so roughly handled that
he did not harry their departure seriously. The Royal Air Force engaged the main strength of the German Air Force, and inflicted
upon them losses of at least four to one; and the Navy, using nearly
1,100 ships of all kinds, carried over 335,000 men, French and
British, out of the jaws of death and shame, to their native land and
to the tasks which lie immediately ahead. We must be very careful
not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are
not won by evacuations. But there was a victory inside this
deliverance, which should be noted. It was gained by the Air Force.
Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the Air Force at
work; they saw only the bombers which escaped its protective attack.
They underrate its achievements. I have heard much talk of this; that
is why I go out of my way to say this. I will tell you about it.
This was a great trial of strength between the British and German
Air Forces. Can you conceive a greater objective for the Germans in
the air than to make evacuation from these beaches impossible, and
to sink all these ships which were displayed, almost to the extent of
thousands? Could there have been an objective of greater military
importance and signIficance for the whole purpose of the war than
this? They tried hard, and they were beaten back; they were
frustrated in their task. We got the Army away; and they have paid
fourfold for any losses which they have inflicted. Very large
formations of German aeroplanes - and we know that they are a
very brave race - have turned on several occasions from the attack of
one-quarter of their number of the Royal Air Force, and have
dispersed in different directions. Twelve aeroplanes have been hunted
by two. One aeroplaTle was driven into the water and cast away by
the mere charge of a British aeroplane, which had no more
ammunition. All of our types - the Hurricane, the Spitfire and the
new Defiant - and all our pilots have been vindicated as superior to
what they have at present to face.
When we consider how much greater would be our advantage in
defending the air above this Island against an overseas attack, I must
say that I find in these facts a sure basis upon which practical and
reassuring thoughts may rest. I will pay my tribute to these young
airmen. The great French Army was very largely, for the time being,
cast back and disturbed by the onrush of a few thousands of
armoured vehicles. May it not also be that the cause of civilisation
itself will be defended by the skill and devotion of a few thousand
airmen? There never has been, I suppose, in all the world, in all the
history of war, such an opportunity for youth. The Knights of the
Round Table, the Crusaders, all fall back into the past - not only distant but prosaic; these young men, going forth every morn to
guard their native land and all that we stand for, holding in their
hands these instruments of colossal and shattering power, of whom it
may be said that
Every morn brought forth a noble chance
And every chance brought forth a noble knight,
deserve our gratitude, as do all the brave men who, in so many ways
and on so many occasions, are ready, and continue ready to give life
and all for their native land.
I return to the Army. In the long series of very fierce battles, now
on this front, now on that, fighting on three fronts at once, battles
fought by two or three divisions against an unequal or somewhat
larger number of the enemy, and fought fiercely on some of the old
grounds that so many of us knew so well - in these battles our losses
in men have exceeded 30,000 killed, wounded and missing. I take
occasion to express the sympathy of the House to all who have
suffered bereavement or who are still anxious. The President of the
Board of Trade [Sir Andrew Duncan] is not here today. His son has
been killed, and many in the House have felt the pangs of affliction in
the sharpest form. But I will say this about the missing: We have had
a large number of wounded come home safely to this country, but I
would say about the missing that there may be very many reported
missing who will come back home, some day, in one way or another.
In the confusion of this fight it is inevitable that many have been left
in positions where honour required no further resistance from them.
Against the loss of over 30,000 men, we can set a far heavier loss
certainly inflicted upon the enemy. But our losses in material are
enormous. We have perhaps lost one-third of the men we lost in the
opening days of the battle of 21st March, 1918, but we have lost
nearly as many guns - nearly one thousand - and all our transport,
all the armoured vehicles that were with the Army in the north. This
loss will impose a further delay on the expansion of our military
strength. That expansion had not been proceeding as far as we had
hoped. The best of all we had to give had gone to the British
Expeditionary Force, and although they had not the numbers of
tanks and some articles of equipment which were desirable, they
were a very well and finely equipped Army. They had the first fruits
of all that our industry had to give, and that is gone. And now here is
this further delay. How long it will be, how long it will last, depends upon the exertions which we make in this Island. An effort the like or
which has never been seen in our records is now being made. Work is
proceeding everywhere, night and day, Sundays and week days.
Capital and Labour have cast aside their interests, rights, and
customs and put them into the common stock. Already the flow of
munitions has leaped forward. There is no reason why we should nor
in a few months overtake the sudden and serious loss that has come
upon us, without retarding the development of our general programme.
Nevertheless, our thankfulness at the escape of our Army and so
many men, whose loved ones have passed through an agonising
week, must not blind us to the fact that what has happened in France
and Belgium is a colossal military disaster. The French Army has
been weakened, the Belgian Army has been lost, a large part of those
fortified lines upon which so much faith had been reposed is gone,
many valuable mining districts and factories have passed into the
enemy's possession, the whole of the Channel ports are in his hands,
with all the tragic consequences that follow from that, and we must
expect another blow to be struck almost immediately at us or at
France. We are told that Herr Hitler has a plan for invading the
British Isles. This has often been thought of before. When Napoleon
lay at Boulogne for a year with his flat-bottomed boats and his
Grand Army, he was told by someone. 'There are bitter weeds in
England.' There are certainly a great many more of them since the
British Expeditionary Force returned.
The whole question of home defence against invasion is, of course,
powerfully affected by the fact that we have for the time being in this
Island incomparably more powerful military forces than we have
ever had at any moment in this war or the last. But this will not
continue. We shall not be content with a defensive war. We have our
duty to our Ally. We have to reconstitute and build up the British
Expeditionary Force once again, under its gallant Commander-inChief, Lord Gort. All this is in train; but in the interval we must put
our defences in this Island into such a high state of organisation that
the fewest possible numbers will be required to give effective security
and that the largest possible potential of offensive effort may be
realised. On this we are now engaged. It will be very convenient, if it
be the desire of the House, to enter upon this subject in a secret
Session. Not that the government would necessarily be able to reveal
in very great detail military secrets, but we like to have our
discussions free, without the restraint imposed by the fact that they will be read the next day by the enemy; and the Government would
benefit by views freely expressed in all parts of the House by
Members with their knowledge of so many different parts of the
country. I understand that some request is to be made upon this
subject, which will be readily acceded to by His Majesty's Government.
We have found it necessary to take measures of increasing
stringency, not only against enemy aliens and suspicious characters
of other nationalitie!>, but also against British subjects who may
become a danger or a nuisance should the war be transported to the
United Kingdom. I know there are a great many people affected by
the orders which we have made who are the passionate enemies of
Nazi Germany. I am very sorry for them, but we cannot, at the
present time and under the present stress, draw all the distinctions
which we should like to do. If parachute landings were attempted
and fierce fighting attendant upon them followed, these unfortunate
people would be far better out of the way, for their own sakes as well
as for ours. There is, however, another class, for which I feel not the
slightest sympathy. Parliament has given us the powers to put down
Fifth Column activities with a strong hand, and we shall use those
powers subject to the supervision and correction of the House,
without the slightest hesitation until we are satisfied, and more than
satisfied, that this malignancy in our midst has been effectively
stamped out.
Turning once again, and this time more generally, to the question
of invasion, I would observe that there has never been a period in all
these long centuries of which we boast when an absolute guarantee
against invasion, still less against serious raids, could have been given
to our people. In the days of Napoleon the same wind which would
have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven
away the blockading fleet. There was always the chance, and it is that
chance which has excited and befooled the imaginations of many
Continental tyrants. Many are the tales that are told. We are assured
that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality
of malice, the ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we
may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind of novel stratagem
and every kind of brutal and treacherous manoeuvre. I think that no
idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered and viewed
with a searching, but at the same time, I hope, with a steady eye. We
must never forget the solid assurances of sea power and those which
belong to air power if it can be locally exercised. I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is
neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being
made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island
home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of
tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is
what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty's
Government - every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and
the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked
together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death
their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost
of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old
and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo
and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail.
We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on
the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and
growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the
cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the
landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we
shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I
do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were
subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed
and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until,
in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might,
steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old. "
"'The news from France is very bad', 17 June 1940, Broadcast, London",,"The news from France is very bad and I grieve for the gallant French people who have fallen into this terrible misfortune. Nothing will alter our feelings towards them or our faith that the genius of France
will rise again. What has happened in France makes no difference to
our actions and purpose. We have become the sole champions now
in arms to defend the world cause. We shall do our best to be worthy
of this high honour. We shall defend our Island home, and with the
British Empire we shall fight on unconquerable until the curse of
Hitler is lifted from the brows of mankind. We are sure that in the
end all will come right. "
"'This was their finest hour', 18 June 1940, House of Commons",,"I spoke the other day of the colossal military disaster which occurred
when the French High Command failed to withdraw the northern
Armies from Belgium at the moment when they knew that the French
front was decisively broken at Sedan and on the Meuse. This delay
entailed the loss of fifteen or sixteen French divisions and threw out
of action for the critical period the whole of the British Expeditionary
Force. Our Army and 120,000 French troops were indeed rescued by
the British Navy from Dunkirk but only with the loss of their
cannon, vehicles and modern equipment. This loss inevitably took
some weeks to repair, and in the first two of those weeks the battle in
France has been lost. When we consider the heroic resistance made
by the French Army against heavy odds in this battle, the enormous
losses inflicted upon the enemy and the evident exhaustion of the
enemy, it may well be the thought that these 25 divisions of the besttrained and best-equipped troops might have turned the scale.
However, General Weygand had to fight without them. Only three
British divisions or their equivalent were able to stand in the line with
their French comrades. They have suffered severely, but they have
fought well. We sent every man we could to France as fast as we
could re-equip and transport their formations. I spoke the other day of the colossal military disaster which occurred

I judge to be utterly futile and even harmful. We cannot afford it. I
recite them in order to explain why it was we did not have, as we
could have had, between twelve and fourteen British divisions
fighting in the line in this great battle instead of only three. Now I put
all this aside. I put it on the shelf, from which the historians, when
they have time, will select their documents to tell their stories. We
have to think of the future and not of the past. This also applies in a
small way to our own affairs at home. There are many who would
hold an inquest in the House of Commons on the conduct of the
Governments - and of Parliaments, for they are in it, too - during the
years which led up to this catastrophe. They seek to indict those who
were responsible for the guidance of our affairs. This also would be a
foolish and perniciGus process. There are too many in it. Let each
man search his conscience and search his speeches. I frequently
search mine.
Of this I am quite sure, that if we open a quarrel between the past
and the present, we sh:l.ll find that we have lost the future. Therefore,
I cannot accept the drawing of any distinctions between Members of
the present Government. It was formed at a moment of crisis in order
to unite all the Parties and all sections of opinion. It has received the
almost unanimous support of both Houses of Parliament. Its
Members are going to stand together, and, subject to the authority of
the House of Commons, we are going to govern the country and
fight the war. It is absolutely necessary at a time like this that every
Minister who tries each day to do his duty shall be respected; and
their subordinates must know that their chiefs are not threatened
men, men who are here today and gone tomorrow, but that their
directions must be punctually and faithfully obeyed. Without this
concentrated power we cannot face what lies before us. I should not
think it would be very advantageous for the House to prolong this
Debate this afternoon under conditions of public stress. Many facts
are not clear that will be clear in a short time. We are to have a secret
Session on Thursday, and I should think that would· be a better
oportunity for the many earnest expressions of opinion which
Members will desire to make and for the House to discuss vital
matters without having everything read the next morning by our
dangerous foes.
The disastrous military events which have happened during the
past fortnight have not corne to me with any sense of surprise.
Indeed, I indicated a fortnight ago as clearly as I could to the House
that the worst possibilities were open; and I made it perfectly clear then that whatever happened in France would make no difference to
the resolve of Britain and the British Empire to fight on, 'if necessary
for years, if necessary alone.' During the last few days we have
successfully brought off the great majority of the troops we had on
the line of communication in France; and seven-eighths of the troops
we have sent to France since the beginning of the war - that is to say,
about 350,000 out of 400,000 men - are safely back in this country.
Others are still fighting with the French, and fighting with considerable success in their local encounters with the enemy. We have also
brought back a great mass of stores, rifles and munitions of all kinds
which had been accumulated in France during the last nine months.
We have, therefore, in this Island today a very large and powerful
military force. This force comprises all our best-trained and our finest
troops, including scores of thousands of those who have already
measured their quality against the Germans and found themselves at
no disadvantage. We have under anns at the present time in this
Island over a million and a quarter men. Behind these we have the
Local Defence Volnnteers, numbering half a million, only a portion
of whom, however, are yet armed with rifles or other firearms. We
have incorporated into our Defence Forces every man for whom we
have a weapon. We expect very large additions to our weapons in the
near future, and in preparation for this we intend forthwith to call
up, drill and train further large numbers. Those who are not called
up, or else are employed during the vast business of munitions
production in all its branches - and their ramifications are innumerable - will serve their country best by remaining at their ordinary
work until they receive their summons. We have also over here
Dominions armies. The Canadians had actually landed in France,
but have now been safely withdrawn, much disappointed, but in
perfect order, with all their artillery and equipment. And these very
high-class forces from the Dominions will now take part in the
defence of the Mother Country.
Lest the account which I have given of these large forces should
raise the question: Why did they not take part in the great battle in
France? I must make it clear that, apart from the divisions training
and organising at home, only 12 divisions were equipped to fight
upon a scale which justified their being sent abroad. And this was
fully up to the number which the French had been led to expect
would be available in France at the ninth month of the war. The rest
of our forces at home have a fighting value for home defence which
will, of course, steadily increase every week that passes. Thus, the
invasion of Great Britain would at this time require the transportation across the sea of hostile armies on a very large scale, and after they
had been so transported they would have to be continually
maintained with all the masses of munitions and supplies which are
required for continuous battle - as continuous battle it will surely be.
Here is where we come to the Navy - and, after all, we have a
Navy. Some people seem to forget that we have a Navy. We must
remind them. For the last thirty years I have been concerned in
discussions about the possibilities of oversea invasion, and I took the
responsibility on behalf of the Admiralty, at the beginning of the last
war, of allowing all regular troops to be sent out of the country. That
was a very serious step to take, because our Territorials had only just
been called up and were quite untrained. Therefore, this Island was
for several months particularly denuded of fighting troops. The
Admiralty had confidence at that time in their ability to prevent a
mass invasion even though at that time the Germans had a
magnificent battle fleet in the proportion of 10 to 16, even though
they were capable of fighting a general engagement every day and
any day, whereas now they have only a couple of heavy ships worth
speaking of - the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau. We are also told
that the Italian Navy is to come out and gain sea superiority in these
waters. If they seriously intend it, I shall only say that we shall be
delighted to offer Signor Mussolini a free and safeguarded passage
through the Strait of Gibraltar in order that he may play the part to
which he aspires. There is a general curiosity in the British Fleet to
find out whether the Italians are up to the level they were at in the
last war or whether th;;y have fallen off at all.
Therefore, it seems to me that as far as seaborne invasion on a
great scale is concerned, we are far more capable of meeting it today
than we were at many periods in the last war and during the early
months of this war, before our other troops were trained, and while
the BEF had proceeded abroad. Now, the Navy have never pretended
to be able to prevent raids by bodies of 5,000 or 10,000 men flung
suddenly across and thrown ashore at several points on the coast
some dark night or foggy morning. The efficacy of sea power,
especially under modern conditions, depends upon the invading force
being of large size. It has to be of large size, in view of our military
strength, to be of any use. If it is of large size, then the Navy have
something they can find and meet and, as it were, bite on. Now, we
must remember that even five divisions, however lightly equipped,
would require 200 to 250 ships, and with modern air reconnaissance
and photography it would not be easy to collect such an armada,
marshal it, and conduct it across the sea without any powerful  forces to escort it; and there would be very great possibilities, to put
it mildly, that this armada would be intercepted long before it
reached the coast, and all the men drowned in the sea or, at the
worst, blown to pieces with their equipment while they were trying
to land. We also have a great system of minefields, recently strongly
reinforced, through which we alone know the channels. If the enemy
tries to sweep passages through these minefields, it will be the task of
the Navy to destroy the minesweepers and any other forces employed
to protect them. There should be no difficulty in this, owing to our
great superiority at sea.
Those are the regular, well-tested, well-proved arguments on
which we have relied during many years in peace and war. But the
question is whether there are any new methods by which those solid
assurances can be circumvented. Odd as it may seem, some attention
has been given to this by the Admiralty, whose prime duty and
responsibility is to destroy any large seaborne expedition before it
reaches, or at the moment when it reaches, these shores. It would not
be a good thing for me to go into details of this. It might suggest
ideas to other people which they have not thought of, and they
would not be likely to give us any of their ideas in exchange. All I
will say is that untiring vigilance and mind-searching must be
devoted to the subject, because the enemy is crafty and cunning and
full of novel treacheries and stratagems. The House may be assured
that the utmost ingenuity is being displayed and imagination is being
evoked from large numbers of competent officers, well-trained in
tactics and thoroughly :.lp to date, to measure and counterwork novel
possibilities. Untiring vigilance and untiring searching of the mind is
being, and must be, devoted to the subject, because, remember, the
enemy is crafty and there is no dirty trick he will not do.
Some people will ask why, then, was it that the British Navy was
not able to prevent the movement of a large army from Germany into
Norway across the Skagerrak? But the conditions in the Channel and
in the North Sea are in no way like those which prevail in the
Skagerrak. In the Skagerrak, because of the distance, we could give
no air support to our surface ships, and consequently, lying as we did
close to the enemy's main air power, we were compelled to use only
our submarines. We could not enforce the decisive blockade or
interruption which is possible from surface vessels. Our submarines
took a heavy toll but could not, by themselves, prevent the invasion
of Norway. In the Channel and in the North Sea, on the other hand,
our superior naval surface forces, aided by our submarines, will
operate with close and effective air assistance. This brings me, naturally, to the great question of invasion from
the air, and of the impending struggle between the British and
German Air Forces. It seems quite clear that no invasion on a scale
beyond the capacity of our land forces to crush speedily is likely to
take place from the air until our Air Force has been definitely
overpowered. In the meantime, there may be raids by parachute
troops and attempted descents of airborne soldiers. We should be
able to give those gentry a warm reception both in the air and on the
ground, if they reach it in any condition to continue the dispute. But
the great question is: Can we break Hitler's air weapon? Now, of
course, it is a very great pity that we have not got an Air Force at
least equal to that of the most powerful enemy within striking
distance of these shores. But we have a very powerful Air Force
which has proved itself far superior in quality, both in men and in
many types of machine, to what we have met so far in the numerous
and fierce air battles which have been fought with the Germans. In
France, where we were at a considerable disadvantage and lost many
machines on the ground when they were standing round the
aerodromes, we were accustomed to inflict in the air losses of as
much as two and two-and-a-half to one. In the fighting over
Dunkirk, which was a sort of no-man's-land, we undoubtedly beat
the German Air Force, and gained the mastery of the local air,
inflicting here a loss of three or four to one day after day. Anyone
who looks at the photographs which were published a week or so
ago of the re-embarkation, showing the masses of troops assembled
on the beach and forming an ideal target for hours at a time, must
realise that this re-embarkation would not have been possible unless
the enemy had resigned all hope of recovering air superiority at that
time and at that place.
In the defence of this Island the advantages to the defenders will be
much greater than they were in the fighting around Dunkirk. We
hope to improve on the rate of three or four to one which was
realised at Dunkirk; and in addition all our injured machines and
their crews which get down safely - and, surprisingly, a very great
many injured machines and men do get down safely in modern air
fighting - all of these will fall, in an attack upon these Islands, on
friendly soil and live to fight another day; whereas all the injured
enemy machines and their complements will be total losses as far as
the war is concerned.
During the great battle in France, we gave very powerful and
continuous aid to the French Army, both by fighters and bombers;
but in spite of every kind of pressure we never would allow the entire metropolitan fighter strength of the Air Force to be consumed. This
decision was painful, but it was also right, because the fortunes of the
battle of France could not have been decisively affected even if we
had thrown in our entire fighter force. That battle was lost by the
unfortunate strategical opening, by the extraordinary and unforeseen
power of the armoured columns, and by the great preponderance of
the German Army in numbers. Our fighter Air Force might easily
have been exhausted as a mere accident in that great struggle, and
then we should have found ourselves at the present time in a very
serious plight. But as it is, I am happy to inform the House that our
fighter strength is stronger at the present time relatively to the
Germans, who have suffered terrible losses, than it has ever been; and
consequently we believe ourselves possessed of the capacity to
continue the war in the air under better conditions than we have ever
experienced before. I look forward confidently to the exploits of our
fighter pilots - these splendid men, this brilliant youth - who will
have the glory of saving their native land, their island home, and all
they love, from the most deadly of all attacks.
There remains, of course, the danger of bombing attacks, which
will certainly be made very soon upon us by the bomber forces of the
enemy. It is true that the German bomber force is superior in
numbers to ours; but we have a very large bomber force also, which
we shall use to strike at military targets in Germany without
intermission. I do not at all underrate the severity of the ordeal which
lies before us; but I believe our countrymen will show themselves
capable of standing up to it, like the brave men of Barcelona, and
will be able to stand up to it, and carryon in spite of it, at least as
well as any other people in the world. Much will depend upon this;
every man and every woman will have the chance to show the finest
qualities of their race, and render the highest service to their cause.
For all of us, at this time, whatever our sphere, our station, our
occupation or our duties, it will be a help to remember the famous
lines:
He nothing common did or mean,
Upon that memorable scene.
I have thought it right upon this occasion to give the House and
the country some indication of the solid, practical grounds upon
which we base our inflexible resolve to continue the war. There are a
good many people who say, 'Never mind. Win or lose, sink or swim,
better die than submit to tyranny - and such a tyranny.' And I do not dissociate myself from them. But I can assure them that our
professional advisers of the three Services unitedly advise that we
should carryon the war, and that there are good and reasonable
hopes of final victory. We have fully informed and consulted all the
self-governing Dominions, these great communities far beyond the
oceans who have been built up on our laws and on our civilisation,
and who are absolutely free to choose their course, but are absolutely
devoted to the ancient Motherland, and who feel themselves inspired
by the same emotions which lead me to stake our all upon duty and
honour. We have fully consulted them, and I have received from their
Prime Ministers, Mr Mackenzie King of Canada, Mr Menzies of
Australia, Mr Fraser of New Zealand, and General Smuts of South
Africa - that wonderful man, with his immense profound mind, and
his eye watching from a distance the whole panorama of European
affairs - I have received from all these eminent men, who all have
Governments behind them elected on wide franchises, who are all
there because they represent the will of their people, messages
couched in the mo:;t moving terms in which they endorse our
decision to fight on, and declare themselves ready to share our
fortunes and to persevere to the end. That is what we are going to do.
We may now ask ourselves: In what way has our position
worsened since the beginning of the war? It has worsened by the fact
that the Germans have conquered a large part of the coastline of
Western Europe, and many small countries have been overrun by
them. This aggravates the possibilities of air attack and adds to our
naval preoccupations. It in no way diminishes, but on the contrary
definitely increases, the power of our long-distance blockade.
Similarly, the entrance of Italy into the war increases the power of
our long-distance blockade. We have stopped the worst leak by that.
We do not know whether military resistance will come to an end in
France or not, but should it do so, then of course the Germans will be
able to concentrate their forces, both military and industrial, upon
us. But for the reasons I have given to the House these will not be
found so easy to apply. If invasion has become more imminent, as no
doubt it has, we, being relieved from the task of maintaining a large
army in France, have far larger and more efficient forces to meet it.
If Hitler can bring under his despotic control the industries of the
countries he has conquered, this will add greatly to his already vast
armament output. On the other hand, this will not happen
immediately, and we are now assured of immense, continuous and
increasing support in supplies and munitions of all kinds from the
United States; and especially of aeroplanes and pilots from the Dominions and across the oceans coming from regions which are
beyond the reach of enemy bombers.
I do not see how any of these factors can operate to our detriment
on balance before the winter comes; and the winter will impose a
strain upon the Nazi regime, with almost all Europe writhing and
starving under its cruel heel, which, for all their ruthlessness, will run
them very hard. We must not forget that from the moment when we
declared war on the 3rd September it was always possible for
Germany to turn all her Air Force upon this country, together with
any other devices of invasion she might conceive, and that France
could have done little or nothing to prevent her doing so. We have,
therefore, lived under the danger, in principle and in a slightly
modified form, during all these months. In the meanwhile, however,
we have enormously improved our methods of defence, and we have
learned what we had no right to assume at the beginning, namely,
that the individual aircraft and the individual British pilot have a sure
and definite superiority. Therefore, in casting up this dread balancesheet and contemphting our dangers with a disillusioned eye, I see
great reason for intense vigilance and exertion, but none whatever
for panic or despair.
During the first four years of the last war the Allies experienced
nothing but disaster and disappointment. That was our constant
fear: one blow after another, terrible losses, frightful dangers.
Everything miscarried. And yet at the end of those four years the
morale of the Allies was higher than that of the Germans, who had
moved from one aggressive triumph to another, who stood everywhere triumphant invaders of the lands into which they had broken.
During that war we repeatedly asked ourselves the question: How
are we going to win? and no one was able ever to answer it with
much precision, until at the end, quite suddenly, quite unexpectedly,
our terrible foe collapsed before us, and we were so glutted with
victory that in our folly we threw it away.
We do not yet know what will happen in France or whether the
French resistance will be prolonged, both in France and in the French
Empire overseas. The French Government will be throwing away
great opportunities and casting adrift their future if they do not
continue the war in accordance with their Treaty obligations, from
which we have not felt able to release them. The House will have
read the historic declaration in which, at the desire of many
Frenchmen - and of our own hearts - we have proclaimed our
willingness at the darkest hour in French history to conclude a union
of common citizenship in this struggle. However matters may go in France or with the French Government, or other French Governments, we in this Island and in the British Empire will never lose our
sense of comradeship with the French people. If we are now called
upon to endure what they have been suffering, we shall emulate their
courage, and if final victory rewards our toils they shall share the
gains, aye, and freedom shall be restored to all. We abate nothing of
our just demands; not one jot or tittle do we recede. Czechs, Poles,
Norwegians, Dutch, Belgians have joined their causes to our own. All
these shall be restored.
What General Weygand called the Battle of France is over. I expect
that the Battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon this battle depends
the survival of Christian civilisation. Upon it depends our own
British life, and the long continuity of our institutions and our
Empire. The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be
turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island
or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free
and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit
uplands. But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United
States, including all tha1: we have known and cared for, will sink into
the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more
protracted, by the lights of perverted science. Let us therefore brace
ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the British
Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will
still say, 'This was their finest hour.' "
"Destruction of the French Fleet, 4 July 1940, House of Commons",,"It is with sincere sorrow that I must now announce to the House the measures which we have felt bound to take in order to prevent the French Fleet from falling into German hands. When two nations are fighting together under long and solemn alliance against a common foe, one of them may be stricken down and overwhelmed, and may be forced to ask its ally to reiease it from its obligations. But the least that could be expected was that the French Government, in abandoning the conflict and leaving its whole weight to fall upon Great Britain and the British Empire, would have been careful not to inflict needless injury I.!pon their faithful comrade, in whose final victory the sole chance of French freedom lay, and lies .... Two of the finest vessels of the French Fleet, the Dunkerque and the Strasbourg, modern battle-cruisers much superior to Scharnhorst and Gneisenau - and built for the purpose of being superior to them - lay with two battleships, several light cruisers, and a number of destroyers and submarines and other vessels at Oran and at its adjacent military port of Mers-el-Kebir on the northern African shore of Morocco. Yesterday morning, a carefully chosen British officer, Captain Holland, late Naval Attache in Paris, was sent on in a destroyer and waited upon the French Admiral Gensoul. After being refused an interview, he presented the following document, which I will read to the House. The first two paragraphs of the document deal with the general question of the Armistice, which I have already explained in my own words. The fourth paragraph begins as follows - this is the operative paragraph: It is impossible for us, your comrades up to now, to allow your fine ships to fall into the power of the German or Italian enemy. We are determined to fight on to the end, and if we win, as we think we shall, we shall never forget that France was our Ally, that our interests are the same as hers, and that our common enemy is Germany. Should we conquer, we solemnly Jeclare that we shall restore the greatness and territory of France. For this purpose, we must make sure that the best ships of the French Navy are not used against us by the common foe. In these circumstances, His Majesty's Government have instructed me
[that is, the British Admiral] to demand that the French Fleet now at
Mers-el-Kebir and Oran shall act in accordance with one of the
following alternatives:
(a) Sail with us and continue to fight for victory against the
Germans and Italians.
(b) Sail with reduced crews under our control to a British port. The
reduced crews will be repatriated at the earliest moment.
If either of these courses is adopted by you, we will restore your
ships to France at the conclusion of the war or pay full compensation,
if they are damaged meanwhile.
(c) Alternatively, if you feel bound to stipulate that your ships
should not be used against the Germans or Italians unless these break
the Armistice, then sail them with us, with reduced crews, to some
French port in the West Indies - Martinique, for instance - where they
can be demilitarised to our satisfaction or be perhaps entrusted to the
United States and remain safe until the end of the war, the crews being
repatriated.
If you refuse these fair offers, I must, with profound regret, require
you to sink your ships within six hours.
Finally, failing the above, I have the orders of His Majesty's
Government to use whatever force may be necessary to prevent your
ships from falling into German or Italian hands.
We had hoped that one or other of the alternatives which we
presented would have been accepted, without the necessity of using
the terrible force of a British battle squadron. Such a squadron
arrived before Oran two hours after Captain Holland and his
destroyer. This battle squadron was commanded by Vice-Admiral
Somerville, an officer who distinguished himself lately in the bringing
off of over 100,000 Frenchmen during the evacuation from Dunkirk.
Admiral Somerville was further provided, besides his battleships,
with a cruiser force and strong flotillas. All day the parleys
continued, and we hoped until the afternoon that our terms would be
accepted without bloodshed. However, no doubt in obedience to the
orders dictated by the Germans from Wiesbaden, where the FrancoGerman Armistice Commission is in session, Admiral Gensoul
refused to comply and announced his intention of fighting. Admiral
Somerville was, therefore, ordered to complete his mission before
darkness fell, and at 5.53 p.m. he opened fire upon this powerful
French Fleet, which was also protected by its shore batteries. At 6
p.m. he reported that he was heavily engaged. The action lasted for some ten minutes and was followed by heavy attacks from our naval
aircraft, carried in the Ark Royal. At 7.20 p.m. Admiral Somerville
forwarded a further report, which stated that a battle-cruiser of the
Strashourg class was damaged and ashore; that a battleship of the
Bretagne class had been sunk, that another of the same class had
been heavily damaged, and that two French destroyers and a
sea plane carrier, Commandant Teste, were also sunk or burned.
While this melancholy action was being fought, either the battlecruiser Strasbourg or the Dunkerque, one or the other, managed to
slip out of harbour in a gallant effort to reach Toulon or a North
African port and place herself under German control, in accordance
with the Armistice terms of the Bordeaux Government - though all
this her crew and captain may not have realised. She was pursued by
aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm and hit by at least one torpedo. She may
have been joined by other French vessels from Algiers, which were
well placed to do so and to reach Toulon before we would overtake
them. She will, at any rate, be out of action for many months to
come.
I need hardly say that the French ships fought, albeit in this
unnatural cause, with the characteristic courage of the French Navy,
and every allowance must be made for Admiral Gensoul and his
officers, who felt themselves obliged to obey the orders they received
from their Government and could not look behind that Government
to see the German dictation. I fear the loss of life among the French
and in the harbour must have been very heavy, as we were compelled
to use a severe measure of force and several immense explosions were
heard. None of the British ships taking part in the action was in any
way affected in gun-power or mobility by the heavy fire directed
upon them. I have not yet received any reports of our casualties, but
Admiral Somerville's Fleet is, in all military respects, intact and ready
for further action. The Italian Navy, for whose reception we had also
made arrangements and which is, of course, considerably stronger
numerically than the Fleet we used at Oran, kept prudently out of the
way. However, we trust that their turn will come during the
operations which we shall pursue to secure the effectual command of
the Mediterranean.
A large proportion of the French Fleet has, therefore, passed into
our hands or has been put out of action or otherwise withheld from
Germany by yesterday's events. The House will not expect me to say
anything about other french ships which are at large except that it is
our inflexible resolve to do everything that is possible in order to
prevent them falling into the German grip. I leave the judgment of our action, with confidence, to Parliament. I leave it to the nation,
and I leave it to the United States. I leave it to the world and history.
Now I turn to the immediate future. We must, of course, expect to
be attacked, or even invaded, if that proves to be possible - it has not
been proved yet - in our own Island before very long. We are making
every preparation in our power to repel the assaults of the enemy,
whether they be directed upon Great Britain, or upon Ireland, which
all Irishmen, without distinction of creed or party, should realise is in
imminent danger. These again are matters upon which we have clear
views. These preparations are constantly occupying our toil from
morn till night, and far into the night. But, although we have clear
views, it would not, I think, be profitable for us to discuss them in
public, or even, so far as the Government are concerned, except
under very considerable reserve in a private Session. I call upon all
subjects of His Majesty, and upon our Allies, and well-wishers - and
they are not a few - all over the world, on both sides of the Atlantic,
to give us their utmost aid. In the fullest harmony with our
Dominions, we are moving through a period of extreme danger and
of splendid hope, when every virtue of our race will be tested, and all
that we have and are will be freely staked. This is no time for doubt
or weakness. It is the supreme hour to which we have been called.
I will venture to reacl to the House a message which I have caused
to be sent to all who are serving in positions of importance under the
Crown, and if the House should view it with sympathy, I should be
very glad to send a copy of it to every Member for his own use - not
that such exhortations are needed. This is the message:
On what may be the eve of an attempted invasion or battle for our
native land, the Prime Minister desires to impress upon all persons
holding responsible positions in the Government, in the fighting
Services, or in the Civil Departments, their duty to maintain a spirit of
alert and confident energy. While every precaution must be taken that
time and means afford, there are no grounds for supposing that more
German troops can be landed in this country, either from the air or
across the sea, than can be destroyed or captured by the strong forces
at present under arms. The Royal Air Force is in excellent order and at
the highest strength it has yet attained. The German Navy was never
so weak, nor the British Army at home so strong as now. The Prime
Minister expects all His Majesty's servants in high places to set an
example of steadiness and resolution. They should check and rebuke
expressions of loose and ill-digested opinion in their circle, or by their
subordinates. They should not hesitate to report, or if necessary remove, any officers or officials who are found to be consciously
exercising a disturbing or depressing influence, and whose talk is
calculated to spread alarm and despondency. Thus alone will they be
worthy of the fighting men, who, in the air, on the sea, and on land,
have already met the enemy without any sense of being outmatched in
martial qualities.
In conclusion, I feel that we are entitled to the confidence of the
House and that we shall not fail in our duty, however painful. The
action we have already taken should be, in itself, sufficient to dispose
once and for all of the lies and rumours which have been so
industriously spread by German propaganda and through Fifth
Column activities that we have the slightest intention of entering into
negotiations in any form and through any channel with the German
and Italian Governments. We shall, on the contrary, prosecute the
war with the utmost vigour by all the means that are open to us until
the righteous purposes for which we entered upon it have been
fulfilled. "
"'The War of the Unknown Warriors', 14 July 1940, Broadcast, London",,"Today is the fourteenth of July, the national festival of France. A year
ago in Paris I watched the stately parade down the Champs Elysees
of the French Army and the French Empire. Who can foresee what
the course of other years will bring? Faith is given to us to help and
comfort us when we stand in awe before the unfurling scroll of
human destiny. And I proclaim my faith that some of us will live to
see a fourteenth of July when a liberated France will once again
rejoice in her greatness and in her glory, and once again stand forward as the champion of the freedom and the rights of man.
When the day dawns, as dawn it will, the soul of France will turn
with comprehension and with kindness to those Frenchmen and
Frenchwomen, wherever they may be, who in the darkest hour did
not despair of the Republic ....
And now it has come to us to stand alone in the breach, and face
the worst that the tyrant's might and enmity can do. Bearing
ourselves humbly before God, but conscious that we serve an
unfolding purpose, Vle are ready to defend our native land against
the invasion by which it is threatened. We are fighting by ourselves
alone; but we are not fighting for ourselves alone. Here in this strong
City of Refuge which enshrines the title-deeds of human progress and
is of deep consequence to Christian civilisation; here, girt about by
the seas and oceans where the Navy reigns; shielded from above by
the prowess and devotion of our airmen - we await undismayed the
impending assault. Perhaps it will come tonight. Perhaps it will come
next week. Perhaps it will never come. We must show ourselves
equally capable of neeting a sudden violent shock or - what is
perhaps a harder test - a prolonged vigil. But be the ordeal sharp or
long, or both, we shaH seek no terms, we shall tolerate no parley; we
may show mercy - we shall ask for none.
I can easily understand how sympathetic onlookers across the
Atlantic, or anxious friends in the yet unravished countries of
Europe, who cannot measure our resources or our resolve, may have
feared for our survival when they saw so many States and kingdoms
torn to pieces in a few weeks or even days by the monstrous force of
the Nazi war machine. But Hitler has not yet been withstood by a
great nation with a will power the equal of his own. Many of these
countries have been poisoned by intrigue before they were struck
down by violence. They have been rotted from within before they
were smitten from without. How else can you explain what has
happened to France? - to the French Army, to the French people, to
the leaders of the French people? ...
We have a million and a half men in the British Army under arms
tonight, and every week of June and July has seen their organisation,
their defences and their striking power advance by leaps and bounds.
No praise is too high for the officers and men - aye, and civilians -
who have made this immense transformation in so short a time.
Behind these soldiers of the regular Army, as a means of destruction
for parachutists, airborne invaders, and any traitors that may be
found in our midst (but I do not believe there are many - woe betide
them, they will get short shrift) - behind the regular Army we have more than a million of the Local Defence Volunteers, or, as they are
much better called, the 'Home Guard'. These officers and men, a
large proportion of whom have been through the last war, have the
strongest desire to attack and come to close quarters with the enemy
wherever he may appear. Should the invader come to Britain, there
will be no placid lying down of the people in submission before him,
as we have seen, alas, in other countries. We shall defend every
village, every town, and every city. The vast mass of London itself,
fought street by street, could easily devour an entire hostile army;
and we would rather see London laid in ruins and ashes than that it
should be tamely and abjectly enslaved. I am bound to state these
facts, because it is necessary to inform our people of our intentions,
and thus to reassure them ....
I stand at the head of a Government representing all Parties in the
State - all creeds, all caus~s, every recognisable section of opinion.
We are ranged beneath the Crown of our ancient monarchy. We are
supported by a free Parliament and a free Press; but there is one bond
which unites us all and sustains us in the public regard - namely (as is
increasingly becoming known), that we are prepared to proceed to all
extremities, to endure them and to enforce them; that is our bond of
union in His Majesty's Government tonight. Thus only, in times like
these, can nations preserve their freedom; and thus only can they
uphold the cause entrusted to their care.
But all depends now upon the whole life-strength of the British
race in every part of the world and of all our associated peoples and
of all our well-wishers in every land, doing their utmost night and
day, giving all, daring all, enduring all - to the utmost - to the end.
This is no war of chieftains or of princes, of dynasties or national
ambition; it is a war of peoples and of causes. There are vast
numbers, not only in this Island but in every land, who will render
faithful service in this war, but whose names will never be known,
whose deeds will never be recorded. This is a War of the Unknown
Warriors; but let all strive without failing in faith or in duty, and the
dark curse of Hitler will be lifted from our age. "
"'The Few', 20 August 1940, House of Commons",,"Almost a year has passed since the war began, and it is natural for us, I think, to pause on our journey at this milestone and survey the dark, wide field. It is also useful to compare the first year of this second war against German aggression with its forerunner a quarter of a century ago. Although lhis war is in fact only a continuation of the last, very great differences in its character are apparent. In the last war millions of men fought by hurling enormous masses of steel at one another. 'Men and shells' was the cry, and prodigious slaughter was the consequence. In this war nothing of this kind has yet appeared. It is a contlict of strategy, of organisation, of technical apparatus, of science, mechanics and morale. The British casualties in the first 12 months of the Great War amounted to 365,000. In this war, I am thankful tv say, British killed, wounded, prisoners and missing, including civilians, do not exceed 92,000, and of these a large proportion are alive as prisoners of war. Looking more widely around, one may say that throughout all Europe, for one man killed or wounded in the first year perhaps five were killed or wounded in 1914-15. The slaughter is only a small fraction, but the consequences to the belligerents have been even more deadly. We have seen great countries with powerful armies dashed out of coherent existence in a few weeks. We have seen the French Republic and the renowned French Army beaten into complete and total submission with less than the casualties which they suffered in anyone of half a dozen of the battles of 1914-18. The entire body - it might almost seem at times the soul - of France has succumbed to physical effects incomparably less terrible than those which were sustained with fortitude and undaunted willpower 25 years ago. Although up to the present the loss of life has been mercifully diminished, the decisions reached in the course of the struggle are even more profound upon
the fate of nations than anything that has ever happened since
barbaric times. Moves are made upon the scientific and strategic
boards, advantages are gained by mechanical means, as a result of
which scores of millions of men become incapable of further
resistance, or judge themselves incapable of further resistance, and a
fearful game of chess proceeds from check to mate by which the
unhappy players seem to be inexorably bound.
There is another more obvious difference from 1914. The whole of
the warring nations are engaged, not only soldiers, but the entire
population, men, women and children. The fronts are everywhere.
The trenches are dug in the towns and streets. Every village is
fortified. Every road is barred. The front line runs through the
factories. The workmen are soldiers with different weapons but the
same courage. These are great and distinctive changes from what
many of us saw in the struggle of a quarter of a century ago. There
seems to be every reason to believe that this new kind of war is well
suited to the genius and the resources of the British nation and the
British Empire; and that, once we get properly equipped and properly
started, a war of this kind will be more favourable to us than the
sombre mass slaughters of the Somme and Passchendaele. If it is a
case of the whole nation fighting and suffering together, that ought
to suit us, because we are the most united of all the nations, because
we entered the war upon the national will and with our eyes open,
and because we have been nurtured in freedom and individual
responsibility and are the products, not of totalitarian uniformity,
but of tolerance and variety. If all these qualities are turned, as they
are being turned, to the arts of war, we may be able to show the
enemy quite a lot of things that they have not thought of yet. Since
the Germans drove the Jews out and lowered their technical
standards, our science is definitely ahead of theirs. Our geographical
position, the command of the sea, and the friendship of the United
States enable us to draw resources from the whole world and to
manufacture weapons of war of every kind, but especially of the
superfine kinds, on a scale hitherto practised only by Nazi Germany.
Hider is now sprawled over Europe. Our offensive springs are
being slowly compressed, and we must resolutely and methodically
prepare ourselves for the campaigns of 1941 and 1942. Two or three
years are not a long time, even in our short, precarious lives. They are
nothing in the history of the nation, and when we are doing the finest
thing in the world, and have the honour to be the sole champion of
the liberties of all Europe, we must not grudge these years or weary as we toil and struggle through them. It does not follow that our
energies in future years will be exclusively confined to defending
ourselves and our possessions. Many opportunities may lie open to
amphibious power, and we must be ready to take advantage of them.
One of the ways to bring this war to a speedy end is to convince the
enemy, not by words, but by deeds, that we have both the will and
the means, not only to go on indefinitely, but to strike heavy and
unexpected blows. The road to victory may not be so long as we
expect. But we have no right to count upon this. Be it long or short,
rough or smooth, we mean to reach our journey's end.
It is our intention to maintain and enforce a strict blockade, not
only of Germany, but of Italy, France, and all the other countries that
have fallen into the German power. I read in the papers that Herr
Hitler has also proclaimed a strict blockade of the British Islands. No
one can complain of that. I remember the Kaiser doing it in the last
war. What indeed would be a matter of general complaint would be
if we were to prolong the agony of all Europe by allowing food to
come in to nourish the Nazis and aid their war effort, or to allow
food to go in to the subjugated peoples, which certainly would be
pillaged off them by their Nazi conquerors.
There have been many proposals, founded on the highest motives,
that food should be allowed to pass the blockade for the relief of
these populations. I regret that we must refuse these requests. The
Nazis declare that they have created a new unified economy in
Europe. They have repeatedly stated that they possess ample reserves
of food and that they can feed their captive peoples. In a German
broadcast of 27th June it was said that while Mr Hoover's plan for
relieving France, Belgium and Holland deserved commendation, the
German forces had already taken the necessary steps. We know that
in Norway when the German troops went in, there were food
supplies to last for a year. We know that Poland, though not a rich
country, usually produces sufficient food for her people. Moreover,
the other countries which Herr Hitler has invaded all held considerable stocks when the Germans entered and are themselves, in many
cases, very substantial food producers. If all this food is not available
now, it ca~ only be because it has been removed to feed the people of
Germany and to give them increased rations - for a change - during
the last few months. At this season of the year and for some months
to come, there is the ieast chance of scarcity as the harvest has just
been gathered in. The only agencies which can create famine in any
part of Europe, now and during the coming winter, will be German exactions or German failure to distribute the supplies which they
command.
There is another aspect. Many of the most valuable foods are
essential to the manufacture of vital war material. Fats are used to
make explosives. Potatoes make the alcohol for motor spirit. The
plastic materials now so largely used in the construction of aircraft
are made of milk. If the Germans use these commodities to help them
to bomb our women and children, rather than to feed the
populations who produce them, we may be sure that imported foods
would go the same way, directly or indirectly, or be employed to
relieve the enemy of the responsibilities he has so wantonly assumed.
Let Hitler bear his responsibilities to the full, and let the peoples of
Europe who groan beneath his yoke aid in every way the coming of
the day when that yoke will be broken. Meanwhile, we can and we
will arrange in advance for the speedy entry of food into any part of
the enslaved area, when this part has been wholly cleared of German
forces, and has genuinely regained its freedom. We shall do our best
to encourage the building up of reserves of food all over the world,
so that there will always be held up before the eyes of the peoples of
Europe, including - I say deliberately - the German and Austrian
peoples, the certainty that the shattering of the Nazi power will bring
to them all immediate food, freedom and peace.
Rather more than a quarter of a year has passed since the new
Government came into power in this country. What a cataract of
disaster has poured out upon us since then! The trustful Dutch
overwhelmed; their beloved and respected Sovereign driven into
exile; the peaceful city of Rotterdam the scene of a massacre as
hideous and brutal as anything in the Thirty Years' War; Belgium
invaded and beaten down; our own fine Expeditionary Force, which
King Leopold called to his rescue, cut off and almost captured,
escaping as it seemed only by a miracle and with the loss of all its
equipment; our Ally, France, out; Italy in against us; all France in the
power of the enemy, all its arsenals and vast masses of military
material converted or convertible to the enemy's use; a puppet
Government set up at Vichy which may at any moment be forced to
become our foe; the whole western seaboard of Europe from the
North Cape to the Spanish frontier in German hands; all the ports,
all the airfields on this. immense front employed against us as
potential springboards of invasion. Moreover, the German air
power, numerically so far outstripping ours, has been brought so
close to our Island that what we used to dread greatly has come to
pass and the hostile bombers not only reach our shores in a few minutes and from many directions, but can be escorted by their
fighter aircraft. Why, Sir, if we had been confronted at the beginning
of May with such a prospect, it would have seemed incredible that at
the end of a period of horror and disaster, or at this point in a period
of horror and disaster, we should stand erect, sure of ourselves,
masters of our fate and with the conviction of final victory burning
unquenchable in our hearts. Few would have believed we could
survive; none would have believed that we should today not only feel
stronger but should actually be stronger than we have ever been
before.
Let us see what has happened on the other side of the scales. The
British nation and the British Empire, finding themselves alone, stood
undismayed against disaster. No one flinched or wavered; nay, some
who formerly thought of peace, now think only of war. Our people
are united and resolved, as they have never been before. Death and
ruin have become small things compared with the shame of defeat or
failure in duty. We cap not tell what lies ahead. It may be that even
greater ordeals lie before us. We shall face whatever is coming to us.
We are sure of ourselves and of our cause, and that is the supreme
fact which has emerged in these months of trial.
Meanwhile, we have not only fortified our hearts but our Island.
We have rearmed and rebuilt our armies in a degree which would
have been deemed impossible a few months ago. We have ferried
across the Atlantic, in the month of July, thanks to our friends over
there, an immense mass of munitions of all kinds: cannon, rifles,
machine guns, cartridges and shell, all safely landed without the loss
of a gun or a round. The output of our own factories, working as
they have never worked before, has poured forth to the troops. The
whole British Army is at home. More than 2,000,000 determined
men have rifles and bayonets in their hands tonight, and threequarters of them are in regular military formations. We have never
had armies like this in our Island in time of war. The whole Island
bristles against invaders, from the sea or from the air. As I explained
to the House in the middle of June, the stronger our Army at home,
the larger must the invading expedition be, and the larger the
invading expedition, the less difficult will be the task of the Navy in
detecting its assembly and in intercepting and destroying it in
passage; and the greater also would be the difficulty of feeding and
supplying the invaders if ever they landed, in the teeth of continuous
naval and air attack on their communications. All this is classical and
venerable doctrine. As in Nelson's day, the maxim holds, 'Our first line of defence is the enemy's ports.' Now air reconnaissance and
photography have brought to an old principle a new and potent aid.
Our Navy is far stronger than it was at the begining of the war.
The great flow of new construction set on foot at the outbreak is now
beginning to come in. We hope our friends across the ocean will send
us a timely reinforcement to bridge the gap between the peace
flotillas of 1939 and the war flotillas of 1941. There is no difficulty in
sending such aid. The seas and oceans are open. The U-boats are
contained. The magnetic mine is, up to the present time, effectively
mastered. The merchant tonnage under the British flag, after a year
of unlimited U-boat war, after eight months of intensive mining
attack, is larger than when we began. We have, in addition, under
our control at least 4,000,000 tons of shipping from the captive
countries which has taken refuge here or in the harbours of the
Empire. Our stocks of food of all kinds are far more abundant than
in the days of peace, and a large and growing programme of food
production is on foot.
Why do I say all this? Not, assuredly, to boast; not, assuredly, to
give the slightest countenance to complacency. The dangers we face
are still enormous, but so are our advantages and resources. I recount
them because the people have a right to know that there are solid
grounds for the confidence which we feel, and that we have good
reason to believe ourselves capable, as I said in a very dark hour two
months ago, of continuing the war 'if necessary alone, if necessary
for years'. I say it also because the fact that the British Empire stands
invincible, and that Nazidom is still being resisted, will kindle again
the spark of hope in the breasts of hundreds of millions of downtrodden or despairing men and women throughout Europe, and far
beyond its bounds, and that from these sparks there will presently
come cleansing and devouring flame.
The great air battle which has been in progress over this Island for
the last few weeks has recently attained a high intensity. It is too soon
to attempt to assign limits either to its scale or to its duration. We
must certainly expect that greater efforts will be made by the enemy
than any he has so far put forth. Hostile airfields are still being
developed in France and the Low Countries, and the movement of
squadrons and material for attacking us is still proceeding. It is quite
plain that Herr Hitler could not admit defeat in his air attack on
Great Britain without sustaining most serious injury. If after all his
boastings and bloodcurdling threats and lurid accounts trumpeted
round the world of the damage he has inflicted, of the vast numbers
of our Air Force he has shot down, so he says, with so little loss to himself; if after tales of the panic-stricken British crushed in their
holes cursing the plutocratic Parliament which has led them to such a
plight - if after all this his whole air onslaught were forced after a
while tamely to peter out, the Fiihrer's reputation for veracity of
statement might be seriously impugned. We may be sure, therefore,
that he will continue as long as he has the strength to do so, and as
long as any preoccupations he may have in respect of the Russian Air
Force allow him to do so.
On the other hand, the conditions and course of the fighting have
so far been favourable to us. I told the House two months ago that,
whereas in France our fighter aircraft were wont to inflict a loss of
two or three to one upon the Germans, and in the fighting at
Dunkirk, which was a kind of no-man's-land, a loss of about three or
four to one, we expected that in an attack on this Island we should
achieve a larger ratio. This has certainly come true. It must also be
remembered that all the enemy machines and pilots which are shot
down over our Island, or over the seas which surround it, are either
destroyed or captured; "".vhereas a considerable proportion of our
machines, and also of our pilots, are saved, and soon again in many
cases come into action.
A vast and admirable system of salvage, directed by the Ministry
of Aircraft Production, ensures the speediest return to the fighting
line of damaged machines, and the most provident and speedy use of
all the spare parts and material. At the same time the splendid - nay,
astounding - increase in the output and repair of British aircraft and
engines which Lord Bea verbrook has achieved by a genius of
organisation and drive, which looks like magic, has given us
overflowing reserves of every type of aircraft, and an ever-mounting
stream of production both in quantity and quality. The enemy is, of
course, far more numerous than we are. But our new production
already, as I am advised, largely exceeds his, and the American
production is only just beginning to flow in. It is a fact, as I see from
my daily returns, that our bomber and fighter strength now, after all
this fighting, are larger than they have ever been. We believe that we
shall be able to continue the air struggle indefinitely and as long as
the enemy pleases, and the longer it continues the more rapid will be
our approach, first towards that parity, and then into that superiority, in the air upon which in a large measure the decision of the war
depends.
The gratitude of every home in our Island, in our Empire, and
indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes
out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of
the World War by their prowess and by their devotion. Never in the
field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. All
hearts go out to the fighter pilots, whose brilliant actions wtsee with
our own eyes day after day; but we must never forget that all the
time, night after night, month after month, our bomber squadrons
travel far into Germany, find their targets in the darkness by the
highest navigational skill, aim their attacks, often under the heaviest
fire, often with serious loss, with deliberate careful discrimination,
and inflict shattering blows upon the whole of the technical and warmaking structure of the Nazi power. On no part of the Royal Air
Force does the weight of the war fall more heavily than on the
daylight bombers, who will play an invaluable part in the case of
invasion and whose unflinching zeal it has been necessary in the
meanwhile on numerous occasions to restrain.
We are able to verify the results of bombing military targets in
Germany, not only by reports which reach us through many sources,
but also, of course, by photography. I have no hesitation in saying
that this process of bombing the military industries and communications of Germany and the air bases and storage depots from which
we are attacked, which process will continue upon an ever-increasing
scale until the end of the war, and may in another year attain
dimensions hitherto undreamed of, affords one at least of the most
certain, if not the shmtest, of all the roads to victory. Even if the Nazi
legions stood triumphant on the Black Sea, or indeed upon the
Caspian, even if Hitler was at the gates of India, it would profit him
nothing if at the same time the entire economic and scientific
apparatus of German war power lay shattered and pulverised at
home.
The fact that the invasion of this Island upon a large scale has
become a far more difficult operation with every week that has
passed since we saved our Army at Dunkirk, and our very great
preponderance of sea power enable us to turn our eyes and to turn
our strength increasingly towards the Mediterranean and against
that other enemy who, without the slightest provocation, coldly and
deliberately, for greed and gain, stabbed France in the back in the
moment of her agony, and is now marching against us in Africa. The
defection of France has, of course, been deeply damaging to our
position in what is called, somewhat oddly, the Middle East. In the
defence of Somaliland, for instance, we had counted upon strong
French forces attacking the Italians from Jibuti. We had counted also
upon the use of the French naval and air bases in the Mediterranean, and particularly upon the North African shore. We had coun.d
upon the French Fleet. Even though metropolitan France was
temporariiy overrun, there was no reason why the French Navy,
substantial parts of the French Army, the French Air Force and the
French Empire overseas should not have continued the struggle at
our side.
Shielded by overwhelming sea power, possessed of invaluable
strategic bases and of ample funds, France might have remained one
of the great combatants in the struggle. By so doing, France would
have preserved the continuity of her life, and the French Empire
might have advanced with the British Empire to the rescue of the
independence and integrity of the French Motherland. In our own
case, if we had been put in the terrible position of France, a
contingency now happily impossible, although, of course, it would
have been the duty of all war leaders to fight on here to the end, it
would also have been their duty, as I indicated in my speech of 4th
June, to provide as far as possible for the Naval security of Canada
and our Dominions and to make sure they had the means to carryon
the struggle from beyond the oceans. Most of the other countries that
have been overrun by Germany for the time being have persevered
valiantly and faithfully. The Czechs, the Poles, the Norwegians, the
Dutch, the Belgians are still in the field, sword in hand, recognised by
Great Britain and the United States as the sole representative
authorities and lawful Governments of their respective Stares.
That France alone should lie prostrate at this moment is the crime,
not of a great and noble nation, but of what are called 'the men of
Vichy'. We have profound sympathy with the French people. Our
old comradeship with France is not dead. In General de Gaulle and
his gallant band, that comradeship takes an effective form. These free
Frenchmen have been condemned to death by Vichy, but the day will
come, as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow, when their names will
be held in honour, and their names will be graven in stone in the
streets and villages of a France restored in a liberated Europe to its
full freedom and its ancient fame. But this conviction which I feel of
the future cannot affect the immediate problems which confront us in
the Mediterranean and in Africa. It had been decided some time
before the beginning of the war not to defend the Protectorate of
Somaliland. That policy was changed in the early months of the war.
When the French gave in, and when our small forces there, a few
battalions, a few guns, were attacked by all the Italian troops, nearly
two divisions, which had formerly faced the French at Jibuti, it was
right to withdraw our detachments, virtually intact, for action elsewhere. Far larger operations no doubt impend in the Middle East
theatre, and I shall certainly not attempt to discuss or prophesy
about their probable course. We have large armies and many means
of reinforcing them. We have the complete sea command of the
eastern Mediterranean. ~! e intend to do our best to give a good
account of ourselves, and to discharge faithfully and resolutely all
our obligations and duties in that quarter of the world. More than
that I do not think the House would wish me to say at the present
time.
A good many people have written to me to ask me to make on this
occasion a fuller statement of our war aims, and of the kind of peace
we wish to make after the war, than is contained in the very
considerable declaration which was made early in the autumn. Since
then we have made sommon cause with Norway, Holland and
Belgium. We have recognised the Czech Government of Dr BeneS,
and we have told General de Gaulle that our success will carry with it
the restoration of France. I do not think it would be wise at this
moment, while the bade rages and the war is still perhaps only in its
earlier stage, to embark upon elaborate speculations about the future
shape which should be given to Europe or the new securities which
must be arranged to spare mankind the miseries of a third World
War. The ground is not new, it has been frequently traversed and
explored, and many ideas are held about it in common by all good
men, and all free men. But before we can undertake the task of
rebuilding we have not only to be convinced ourselves, but we have
to convince all other countries that the Nazi tyranny is going to be
finally broken. The right to guide the course of world history is the
noblest prize of victory. We are still toiling up the hill; we have not
yet reached the crest-line of it; we cannot survey the landscape or
even imagine what its condition will be when that longed-for
morning comes. The task which lies before us immediately is at once
more practical, more simple and more stern. I hope - indeed, I pray -
that we shall not be found unworthy of our victory if after toil and
tribulation it is granted to us. For the rest, we have to gain the
victory. That is our task.
There is, however, one direction in which we can see a little more
clearly ahead. We have to think not only for ourselves but for the
lasting security of the cause and principle for which we are fighting
and of the long future of the British Commonwealth of Nations.
Some months ago we came to the conclusion that the interests of the
United States and of the British Empire both required that the United
States should have facilities for the naval and air defence of the Western Hemisphere against the attack of a Nazi power which might
have acquired temporary but lengthy control of a large part of
Western Europe and its formidable resources. We had therefore
decided spontaneously, and without being asked or offered any
inducement, to inform the Government of the United States that we
would be glad to place such defence facilities at their disposal by
leasing suitable sites in our Transatlantic possessions for their greater
security against the unmeasured dangers of the future. The principle
of association of interests for common purposes between Great
Britain and the United States had developed even before the war.
Various agreements had been reached about certain small islands in
the Pacific Ocean which had become important as air fuelling points.
In all this line of thought we found ourselves in very close harmony
with the Government of Canada.
Presently we learned that anxiety was also felt in the United States
about the air and naval defence of their Atlantic seaboard, and
President Roosevelt has recently made it clear that he would like to
discuss with us, and with the Dominion of Canada and with
Newfoundland, the development of American naval and air facilities
in Newfoundland and in the West Indies. There is, of course, no
question of any transference of sovereignty - that has never been
suggested - or of any a(:tion being taken without the consent or
against the wishes of the various Colonies concerned; but for our
part, His Majesty's Government are entirely willing to accord
defence facilities to the United States on a 99 years' leasehold basis,
and we feel sure that our interests no less than theirs, and the
interests of the Colonies themselves and of Canada and Newfoundland, will be served thereby. These are important steps. Undoubtedly
this process means that these two great organisations of the Englishspeaking democracies, the British Empire and the United States, will
have to be somewhat mixed up together in some of their affairs for
mutual and general advap..tage. For my own part, looking out upon
the future, I do not view the process with any misgivings. I could not
stop it if I wished; no one can stop it. Like the Mississippi, it just
keeps rolling along. Let it roll. Let it roll on full flood, inexorable,
irresistible, benignant, to broader lands and better days. "
"Fifty American destroyers, 5 September 1940, House of Commons",,"The memorable transactions between Great Britain and the United States, which were foreshadowed when I last addressed the House, have now been completed. As far as I can make out, they have been completed to the general satisfaction of the British and American peoples and to the encouragement of our friends all over the world. It would be a mistake to try to read into the official notes which have passed more than the documents bear on their face. The exchanges which have taken place are simply measures of mutual assistance rendered to one another by two friendly nations, in a spirit of confidence, sympathy and goodwill. These measures are linked together in a formal agreement. They must be accepted exactly as they stand. Only very ignorant persons would suggest that the transfer of American destroyers to the British flag constitutes the slightest violation of international law or affects in the smallest degree the non-belligerency of the United States. I have no doubt that Herr Hitler will not like this transference of destroyers, and I have no doubt that he will pay the United States out, if ever he gets the chance. That is why I am very glad that the army, air and naval frontiers of the United States have been advanced along a wide arc into the Atlantic Ocean, and that will enable them to take danger by the throat while it is still hundreds of miles away from their homeland. The Admiralty tell us also that they are very glad tc have these 50 destroyers, and that they will come in most conveniently to bridge the gap which, as I have previously explained to the House, inevitably intervenes before our considerable wartime programme of new construction comes into service. I suppose the House realises that we shall be a good deal stronger next year on the sea than we are now, although that is quite strong enough for the immediate work in hand. There will be no delay in bringing the American destroyers into active service; in fact, British
crews are already meeting them at the various ports where they are
being delivered. "
"These cruel; wanton ... bombings', 11 September 1940, Broadcast, London",,"When I said in the House of Commons the other day that I thought it
improbable that the enemy's air attack in September could be more
than three times as great as it was in August, I was not, of course,
referring to barbarous attacks upon the civil population, but to the
great air battle which is being fought out between our fighters and
the German Air Force.
You will understand that whenever the weather is favourable,
waves of German bombers, protected by fighters, often three or four
hundred at a time, surge over this Island, especially the promontory
of Kent, in the hope of attacking military and other objectives by
daylight. However, they are met by our fighter squadrons and nearly
always broken up; and their losses average three to one in machines
and six to one in pilots.
This effort of the Germans to secure daylight mastery of the air
over England is, of course, the crux of the whole war. So far it has
failed conspicuously. It has cost them very dear, and we have felt
stronger, and actually are relatively a good deal stronger, than when
the hard fighting began in July. There is no doubt that Herr Hitler is using up his fighter force at a very high rate, and that if he goes on
for many more weeks he will wear down and ruin this vital part of
his Air Force. That will give us a very great advantage.
On the other hand, for him to try to invade this country without
having secured mastery in the air would be a very hazardous
undertaking. Nevertheless, all his preparations for invasion on a
great scale are steadily going forward. Several hundreds of selfpropelled barges are moving down the coasts of Europe, from the
German and Dutch harbours to the ports of northern France; from
Dunkirk to Brest; and beyond Brest to the French harbours in the
Bay of Biscay.
Besides this, convoys of merchant ships in tens of dozens are being
moved through the Straits of Dover into the Channel, dodging along
from port to port under the protection of the new batteries which the
Germans have built on the French shore. There are now considerable
gatherings of shipping in the German, Dutch, Belgian and French
harbours - all the way from Hamburg to Brest. Finally, there are
some preparations made of ships to carry an invading force from the
Norwegian harbours.
Behind these clusters of ships or barges, there stand very large
numbers of German troops, awaiting the order to go on board and
set out on their very dangerous and uncertain voyage across the seas.
We cannot tell when they will try to come; we cannot be sure that in
fact they will try at all; but no one should blind himself to the fact
that a heavy, full-scale invasion of this Island is being prepared with
all the usual German thoroughness and method, and that it may be
launched now - upon England, upon Scotland, or upon Ireland, or
upon all three.
If this invasion is going to be tried at all, it does not seem that it
can be long delayed. The weather may break at any time. Besides
this, it is difficult for the enemy to keep these gatherings of ships
waiting about indefinitely, while they are bombed every night by our
bombers, and very often shelled by our warships which are waiting
for them outside.
Therefore, we must regard the next week or so as a very important
period in our history. It ranks with the days when the Spanish
Armada was approaching the Channel, and Drake was finishing his
game of bowls; or when Nelson stood between us and Napoleon's
Grand Army at Boulogne. We have read all about this in the history
books; but what is happening now is on a far greater scale and of far
more consequence to the life and future of the world and its
civilisation than these brave old days of the past. Every man and woman will therefore prepare himself to do his
duty, whatever it may be, with special pride and care. Our fleets and
flotillas are very powerful and numerous; our Air Force is at the
highest strength it has ever reached, and it is conscious of its proved
superiority, not indeed in numbers, but in men and machines. Our
shores are well fortified and strongly manned, and behind them,
ready to attack the invaders, we have a far larger and better equipped
mobile Army than we have ever had before.
Besides this, we h~ve more than a million and a half men of the
Home Guard, who are just as much soldiers of the Regular Army as
the Grenadier Guards, and who are determined to fight for every
inch of the ground in every village and in every street.
It is with devout but sure confidence that I say: Let God defend the
Right.
These cruel, wanton, indiscriminate bombings of London are, of
course, a part of Hitler's invasion plans. He hopes, by killing large
numbers of civilians, and women and children, that he will terrorise
and cow the people of this mighty imperial city, and make them a
burden and an anxiety to the Government and thus distract our
attention unduly from the ferocious onslaught he is preparing. Little
does he know the spirit of the British nation, or the tough fibre of the
Londoners, whose forebears played a leading part in the establishment of Parliamentary institutions and who have been bred to value
freedom far above their lives. This wicked man, the repository and
embodiment of many forms of soul-destroying hatred, this monstrous product of former wrongs and shame, has now resolved to try
to break our famous Island race by a process of indiscriminate
slaughter and destruction. What he has done is to kindle a fire in
British hearts, here and all over the world, which will glow long after
all traces of the conflagration he has caused in London have been
removed. He has lighted a fire which will burn with a steady and
consuming flame until the last vestiges of Nazi tyranny have been
burnt out of Europe, and until the Old World - and the New - can
join hands to rebuild the temples of man's freedom and man's
honour, upon foundations which will not soon or easily be
overthrown.
This is a time for everyone to stand together, and hold firm, as they
are doing. I express my admiration for the exemplary manner in
which all the Air Raid Precautions services of London are being
discharged, especially the Fire Brigade, whose work has been so
heavy and also dangerous. All the world that is still free marvels at
the composure and fortitude with which the citizens of London are facing and surmounting the great ordeal to which they are subjected,
the end of which or the severity of which cannot yet be foreseen.
It is a message of good cheer to our fighting Forces on the seas, in
the air, and in our waiting Armies in all their posts and stations, that
we send them from this capital city. They know that they have
behind them a people who will not flinch or weary of the struggle -
hard and protracted though it will be; but that we shall rather draw
from the heart of suffering itself the means of inspiration and
survival, and of a victory won not only for ourselves but for all - a
victory won not only for our own time, but for the long and better
days that are to come. "
"We will all go down fighting to the end', 17 September 1940, House of Commons",,"The reason why I asked the House to go into Secret Session was not because I had anything particularly secret or momentous to say. It was only because there are some things which it is better for us to talk over among ourselves than when we are overheard by the Germans. I wish to speak about the sittings of the House and how we are to discharge our Parliamentary duties .... We ought not to flatter ourselves by imagining that we are irreplaceable, but at the same time it cannot be denied that two or three hundred by-elections would be a quite needless complication of our affairs at this particular juncture. Moreover, I suppose that if Hitler made a clean sweep of the Houses of Parliament it would give widespread and unwholesome satisfaction throughout Germany, and be vaunted as another triumph for the Nazi system of government. We must exercise reasonable prudence and a certain amount of guile
in combating the malice of the enemy. It is no part of good sense to
proclaim the hour and dates of our meetings long beforehand ....
These next few weeks are grave and anxious. I said just now in the
Public Session that the deployment of the enemy's invasion preparations and the assembly of his ships and barges are steadily
proceeding, and that any moment a major assault may be launched
upon this island. I now say in secret that upwards of seventeen
hundred self-propelled barges and more than two hundred seagoing
ships, some very large ships, are already gathering at the many
invasion ports in German occupation. If this is all a pretence and
stratagem to pin us down here, it has been executed with surprising
thoroughness and on a gigantic scale. Some of these ships and barges,
when struck by our hombing counterattack and preventive attack,
have blown up with tremendous explosions, showing that they are
fully loaded with all the munitions needed for the invading armies
and to beat us down and subjugate us utterly. The shipping available
and now assembled is sufficient to carry in one voyage nearly half a
million men. We should, of course, expect to drown a great many on
the way over, and to destroy a large proportion of their vessels. But
when you reflect upon the many points from which they could start,
and upon the fact that even the most likely sector of invasion, i.e., the
sector in which enemy fighter support is available for their bombers
and dive bombers, extending from the Wash to the Isle of Wight, is
nearly as long as the whole front in France from the Alps to the sea,
and also upon the dangers of fog or artificial fog, one must expect
many lodgments or attempted lodgments to be made on our island
simultaneously. These we shall hope to deal with as they occur, and
also to cut off the supply across the sea by which the enemy will seek
to nourish his lodgments.
The difficulties of the invader are not ended when he sets foot on
shore. A new chapter of perils opens upon him. I am confident that
we shall succeed in defeating and largely destroying this most
tremendous onslaught by which we are now threatened, and
anyhow, whatever happens, we will all go down fighting to the end. I
feel as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow that we shall be victorious. "
"We can take it!',8 October 1940, House of Commons",,"A month has passed since Herr Hit\er turned his rage and malic.e on
to the civil population of our great cities and particularly of London.
He declared in his speech of 4th September that he would raze our
cities to the ground, and since then he has been trying to carry out his
fell purpose. Naturally, the first question we should ask is to what
extent the full strength of the German bombing force has been
deployed. I will give the House the best opinion I have been able to
form on what is necessarily to some extent a matter of speculation.
After their very severe mauling on 15th August, the German shortrange dive bombers, of which there are several hundred, have been
kept carefully out of the air fighting. This may be, of course, because
they are being held in reserve so that they may play their part in a
general plan of invasion or re-appear in some other theatre of war.
We have, therefore, had to deal with the long-range German
bombers alone.
It would seem that, taking day and night together, nearly 400 of
these machines have, on the average, visited our shores every 24
hours. We are doubtful whether this rate of sustained attack could be
greatly exceeded ....
Neither by material damage nor by slaughter will the people of the
British Empire be turned from their solemn and inexorable purpose.
It is the practice and in some cases the duty of many of my colleagues
and many Members of the House to visit the scenes of destruction as
promptly as possible, and I go myself from time to time. In all my
life, I have never been treated with so much kindness as by the people
who have suffered most. One would think one had brought some
great benefit to them, instead of the blood and tears, the toil and
sweat which is all I have ever promised. On every side, there is the
cry, 'We can take it,' but with it, there is also the cry, 'Give it 'em
back.' ...
Meanwhile, what has happened to the invasion which we have
been promised every month and almost every week since the
beginning of July? Do not let us be lured into supposing that the
danger is past. On the contrary, unwearying vigilance and the swift and steady strengthening of our Force by land, sea and air which is in
progress must be at all costs maintained. Now that we are in
October, however, the weather becomes very uncertain, and there are
not many lucid intervals of two or three days together in which river
barges can cross the narrow seas and land upon our beaches. Still,
those intervals may occur. Fogs may aid the foe. Our Armies, which
are growing continually in numbers, equipment, mobility and
training, must be maintained all through the winter, not only along
the beaches but in reserve, as the majority are, like leopards
crouching to spring at the invader's throat. The enemy has certainly
got prepared enough shipping and barges to throw half a million
men in a single night on to salt water - or into it. The Home Guard,
which now amounts to 1,700,000 men, must nurse their weapons
and sharpen their bayvnets ....
Because we feel easier in ourselves and see our way more clearly
through our difficulties and dangers than we did some months ago,
because foreign countries, friends or foes, recognise the giant,
enduring, resilient strength of Britain and the British Empire, do not
let us dull for one mome::lt the sense of the awful hazards in which
we stand. Do not let us lose the conviction that it is only by supreme
and superb exertions, unwearying and indomitable, that we shall
save our souls alive. No one can predict, no one can even imagine,
how this terrible war against German and Nazi aggression will run
its course or how far it will spread or how long it will last. Long,
dark months of trials and tribulations lie before us. Not only great
dangers, but many more misfortunes, many shortcomings, many
mistakes, many disappointments will surely be our lot. Death and
sorrow will be the companions of our journey; hardship our
garment; constancy and valour our only shield. We must be united,
we must be undaunted, we must be inflexible. Our qualities and
deeds must burn and glow through the gloom of Europe until they
become the veritable beacon of its salvation. "
"Dieu protege fa France', 21 October 1940, Broadcast, London",,"Frenchmen! For more than thirty years in peace and war I have marched with you, and I am marching still along the same road. Tonight I speak to you at your firesides wherever you may be, or whatever your fortunes are: I repeat the prayer around the louis d'or, 'Dieu protege la France'. Here at home in England, under the fire of the Boche, we do not forget the ties and links that unite us to France, and we are persevering steadfastly and in good heart in the cause of European freedom and fair dealing for the common people of all countries, for which, with you, we drew the sword. When good people get into trouble because they are attacked and heavily smitten by the vile and wicked, they must be very careful not to get at loggerheads with one another. The common enemy is always trying to bring this about, and, of course, in bad luck a lot of things happen which play into the enemy's hands. We must just make the best of things as they come along. Here in London, which Herr Hitler says he will reduce to ashes, and which his aeroplanes are now bombarding, our people are bearing up unflinchingly. Our Air Force has more than held its own. We are waiting for the long-promised invasion. So are the fishes. But, of course, this for us is only the beginning. Now in 1940, in spite of occasional losses, we have, as ever, command of the seas. In 1941 we shall have the command of the air. Remember what that means. Herr Hitler with his tanks and other mechanical weapons, and also by Fifth Column intrigue with traitors, has managed to subjugate for the time being most of the finest races in Europe, and his little Italian accomplice is trotting along hopefully and hungrily, but rather wearily and very timidly, at his side. They both wish to carve up France and her Empire as if it were a fowl; to one a leg, to another a wing or perhaps part of the breast. Not only the French Empire will be devoured by these two ugly customers, but Alsace-Lorraine will go once again under the German yoke, and Nice, Savoy and Corsica
- Napoleon's Corsica - will be torn from the fair realm of France.
But Herr Hitler is not thinking only of stealing other people's
territories, or flinging gobbets of them to his little confederate. I tell
you truly what you must believe when I say this evil man, this
monstrous abortion of hatred and defeat, is resolved on nothing less
than the complete wiping out of the French nation, and the
disintegration of its whole life and future. By all kinds of sly and
savage means, he is plotting and working to quench for ever the
fountain of characteristic French culture and of French inspiration to
the world. All Europe, if he has his way, will be reduced to one
uniform Bache-land, to be exploited, pillaged, and bullied by his
Nazi gangsters. You will excuse my speaking frankly because this is
not a time to mince words. It is not defeat that France will now be
made to suffer at German hands, but the doom of complete
obliteration. Army, Navy, Air Force, religion, law, language, culture,
institutions, literature, history, tradition - all are to be effaced by the
brute strength of a triumphant Army and the scientific low cunning
of a ruthless Police Force.
Frenchmen - rearm your spirits before it is too late. Remember
how Napoleon said before one of his battles: 'These same Prussians
who are so boastful today were three to one at lena, and six to one at
Montmirail.' Never will I believe that the soul of France is dead.
Never will I believe that her place amongst the greatest nations of the
world has been lost for ever! All these schemes and crimes of Herr
Hitler's are bringing upon him and upon all who belong to his
system a retribution which many of us will live to see. The story is
not yet finished, but it will not be so long. We are on his track, and so
are our friends across the Atlantic Ocean, and your friends across the
Atlantic Ocean. If he cannot destroy us, we will surely destroy him
and all his gang, and all their works. Therefore, have hope and faith,
for all will come right.
Now, what is it we British ask of you in this present hard and
bitter time? What we ask at this moment in our struggle to win the
victory which we will share with you, is that if you cannot help us, at
least you will not hinder us. Presently you will be able to weight the
arm that strikes for you, and you ought to do so. But even now we
believe that Frenchmen, wherever they may be, feel their hearts warm
and a proud blood tingle in their veins when we have some success in
the air or on the sea, or presently - for that will come - upon the
land.
Remember we shall never stop, never weary, and never give in, and that our whole people and Empire have vowed themselves to the task
of cleansing Europe from the Nazi pestilence and saving the world
from the new Dark Ages. Do not imagine, as the German-controlled
wireless tells you, that we English seek to take your ships and
colonies. We seek to beat the life and soul out of Hitler and
Hitlerism. That alone, that all the time, that to the end. We do not
covet anything from any nation except their respect. Those French
who are in the French Empire, and those who are in so-called
unoccupied France, may see their way from time to time to useful
action. I will not go into details. Hostile ears are listening. As for
those to whom English hearts go out in full, because they see them
under the sharp discipline, oppression, and spying of the Hun - as to
those Frenchmen in the occupied regions - to them I say, when they
think of the future let them remember the words which Thiers, that
great Frenchman, uttered after 1870 about the future of France and
what was to come: 'Think of it always: speak of it never.'
Good night, then: sleep to gather strength for the morning. For the
morning will come. Brightly will it shine on the brave and true,
kindly upon all who suffer for the cause, glorious upon the tombs of
heroes. Thus will shine the dawn. Vive la France! "
"'Give us the tools', 9 February 1941, Broadcast, London",,"Five months have passed since I spoke to the British nation and the Empire on the broadcast. In wartime there is a lot to be said for the motto: 'Deeds, not words.' All the same, it is a good thing to look around from time to time and take stock, and certainly our affairs have prospered in several directions during these last four or five months, far better than most of us would have ventured to hope. We stood our ground and faced the two Dictators in the hour of what seemed their overwhelming triumph, and we have shown ourselves capable, so far, of standing up against them alone. After the heavy defeats of the German air force by our fighters in August and September, Herr Hitler did not dare attempt the invasion of this Island, although he had every need to do so and although he had made vast preparations. Baffled in this mighty project, he sought to break the spirit of the British nation by the bombing, first of London, and afterwards of our great cities. It has now been proved, to the admiration of the world, and of our friends in the United States, that this form of blackmail by murder and terrorism, so far from weakening the spirit of the British nation, has only roused it to a more intense and universal flame than was ever seen before in any modern community. The whole British Empire has been proud of the Mother Country, and they long to be with us over here in even larger numbers. We have been deeply conscious of the love for us which has flowed from the Dominions of the Crown """"cross the broad ocean spaces. There is the first of our war aims: to be worthy of that love, and to preserve it. All through these dark winter months the enemy has had the power to drop three or four tons of bombs upon us for every ton we could send to Germany in return. We are arranging so that presently this will be rather the other way round; but, meanwhile, London and our big cities have had to stand their pounding. They remind me of the British squares at Waterloo. They are not squares of soldiers; they do not wear scarlet coats. They are just ordinary English, Scottish and Welsh folk - men, women and children - standing steadfastly together. But their spirit is the same, their glory is the same; and, in the end, their victory will be greater than far-famed Waterloo .... It is just exactly two months ago, to a day, that I was waiting anxiously, but also eagerly, for the news of the great counter-stroke which had been planned against the Italian invaders of Egypt. The secret had been well kept. The preparations had been well made. But to leap across those seventy miles of desert, and attack an army of ten or eleven divisions, equipped with all the appliances of modern war, who had been fortifying themselves for three months - that was a most hazardous adventure. When the brilliant decisive victory at Sidi Barrani, with its tens of thousands of prisoners, proved that we had quality, manoeuvring power and weapons superior to the enemy, who had boasted so much of his virility and his military virtues, it was evident that all the other Italian forces in eastern Libya were in great danger. They could not easily beat a retreat along the coastal road without running the
risk of being caught in the open by our armoured divisions and
brigades, ranging far out into the desert in tremendous swoops and
scoops. They had to expose themselves to being attacked piecemeal.
General Wavell - nay, all our leaders, and all their lithe, active,
ardent men, British, Australian, Indian, in the Imperial Army - saw
their opportunity. At that time I ventured to draw General Wavell's
attention to the seventh chapter of the Gospel of St Matthew, at the
seventh verse, where, as you all know - or ought to know - it is
written: 'Ask, and it shall be given; seek, and ye shall find; knock,
and it shall be opened unto you.' The Army of the Nile has asked,
and it was given; they sought, and they have found; they knocked,
and it has been opened unto them. In barely eight weeks, by a
campaign which will long be studied as a model of the military art,
an advance of over 400 miles has been made. The whole Italian
Army in the east of Libya, which was reputed to exceed 150,000
men, has been captured or destroyed. The entire province of
Cyrenaica - nearly as big as England and Wales - has been
conquered. The unhappy Arab tribes, who have for thirty years
suffered from the cruelty of Italian rule, carried in some cases to the
point of methodical extermination, these Bedouin survivors have at
last seen their oppresso{s in disorderly flight, or led off in endless
droves as prisoners of war.
Egypt and the Suez Canal are safe, and the port, the base and the
airfields of Benghazi constitute a str:ltegic point of high consequence
to the whole of the \var in the Eastern Mediterranean.
In order to win the war Hitler must destroy Great Britain. He may
carry havoc into the Balkan States; he may tear great provinces out of
Russia, he may march to the Caspian; he may march to the gates of
India. All this will avail him nothing. It may spend his curse more
widely throughout Europe and Asia, but it will not avert his doom.
With every month that passes the many proud and once happy
countries he is now holding down by brute force and vile intrigue are
learning to hate the Prussian yoke and the Nazi name as nothing has
ever been hated so fiercely and so widely among men before. And all
the time, masters of the sea and air, the British Empire - nay, in a
certain sense, the whole English-speaking world - will be on is track,
bearing with them the swords of justice.
The other day, President Roosevelt gave his opponent in the late
Presidential Election [Mr Wendell Willkie] a letter of introduction to
me, and in it he wrote out a verse, in his own handwriting, from Longfellow, which he said, 'applies to you people as it does to us.'
Here is the verse:
... Sail on, 0 Ship of State!
Sail on, 0 Union, strong and great!
Humanity with all its fears,
With all the hopes of future years,
Is hanging breathless on thy fate!
What is the answer that I shall give, in your name, to this great man,
the thrice-chosen head of a nation of a hundred and thirty millions?
Here is the answer which I will give to President Roosevelt: Put your
confidence in us. Give us your faith and your blessing, and, under
Providence, all will be well.
We shall not fail or falter; we shall not weaken or tire. Neither the
sudden shock of battle, nor the long-drawn trials of vigilance and
exertion will wear us down. Give us the tools, and we will finish the
job. "
"'This Battle of the Atlantic', 18 March 1941, Pilgrims' Society, London",,"We are met here today under the strong impression and impact of the historic declaration made on Saturday last by the President of the United States, and where could there be a more fitting opportunity than at this gathering of the Pilgrims to greet the new American Ambassador for me to express on behalf of the British nation and Empire the sense of encouragement and fortification in our resolve which has come to us from across the ocean in those stirring, august, and fateful presidential words? You have come here, Mr Winant, to
a community which is being tried and proved before mankind and
history, and tried and proved to a degree and on a scale and under
conditions which have not previously been known to human
expenence.
We have here a free society, governed through a Parliament which
rests upon universal suffrage and upon the public opinion of the
whole nation. We are being subjected to daily assaults which, if not
effectively resisted and repelled, would soon prove mortal. We have
to call upon our whole people - men, women, and children alike - to
stand up with composure and fortitude to the fire of the enemy, and
to accept increasing privations while making increasing efforts.
Nothing like this has ever been seen before.
We have our faults, and our social system has its faults, but we
hope that, with God's help, we shall be able to prove for all time, or
at any rate, for a long time, that a State or Commonwealth of
Nations, founded on long-enjoyed freedom and steadily-evolving
democracy, possesses amid the sharpest shocks the faculty of survival
in a high and honourable and, indeed, in a glorious degree. At such a
moment, and under such an ordeal, the words and the acts of the
President and people of the United States come to us like a draught of
life, and they tell us by an ocean-borne trumpet call that we are no
longer alone,
We know that other hearts in millions and scores of millions beat
with ours; that other voices proclaim the cause for which we strive;
other strong hands wield the hammers and shape the weapons we
need; other clear and gleaming eyes are fixed in hard conviction upon
the tyrannies that must and shall be destroyed. We welcome you
here, Mr Winant, at the moment when a great battle in which your
Government and nation are deeply interested is developing its full
scope and severity. The Battle of the Atlantic must be won in a
decisive manner. It must be won beyond all doubt if the declared
policies of the Government and people of the United States are not to
be forcibly frustrated. Not only German U-boats, but German battle
cruisers have crossed to the American side of the Atlantic and have
already sunk some of our independently-routed ships not sailing in
convoy. They have sunk these ships as far west as the 42nd meridian
of longitude.
Over here upon the approaches to our island an intense and
unrelenting struggle is being waged to bring in the endless stream of
munitions and food without which our war effort here and in the
Middle East - for that shall not be relaxed - cannot be maintained. Our losses have risen for the time being, and we are applying our
fullest strength and resource, and all the skill and science we can
command, in order to meet this potentially mortal challenge. And
not only, I must remind you, does our shipping suffer by the attacks
of the enemy, but also the fertility of its importing power is reduced
by many of the precautions and measures which we must take to
master and dominate the attacks which are made upon us.
But our strength is growing every week. The American destroyers
which reached us in the autumn and winter are increasingly coming
into action. Our flotillas are growing in number. Our air power over
the island and over the seas is growing fast. We are striking back
with increasing effect. Only yesterday I received the news of the
certain destruction of three German U-boats. Not since October 13,
1939, had I been cheered by such delectable tidings of a triple event.
It is my rule, as you know, not to conceal the gravity of the danger
from our people, and therefore I have a right to be believed when I
also proclaim our confidence that we shall overcome them. But
anyone can see how bitter is the need of Hitler and his gang to cut the
sea roads between Great Britain and the United States, and, having
divided these mighty Powers, to destroy them one by one. Therefore
we must regard this Battle of the Atlantic as one of the most
momentous ever fought in all the annals of war. Therefore, Mr
Winant, you come to us at a grand turning-point in the world's
history. We rejoice to have you with us in these days of storm and
trial, because we know we have a friend and a faithful comrade who
will 'report us and our cause aright'. But no one who has met you
can doubt that you hold, and embody in a strong and intense degree,
the convictions and ideals which in the name of American democracy
President Roosevelt has proclaimed.
In the last few months we have had a succession of eminent
American citizens visiting these storm-beaten shores and finding
them unconquered and unconquerable - Mr Hopkins, Mr Willkie,
Colonel Donovan, and now today we have here Mr Harriman and
yourself. I have dwelt with all these men in mind and spirit, and there
is one thing I have discerned in them all- they would be ready to give
their lives, nay, be proud to give their lives, rather than that the good
cause should be trampled down and the darkness of barbarism again
engulf mankind. Mr Ambassador, you share our purpose, you will
share our dangers, you will share our anxieties, you shall share our
secrets, and the day will come when the British Empire and the
United States will share together the solemn but splendid duties
which are the crown of victory."
"Yugoslavia invaded, 9 April 1941, House of Commons",,"I therefore turn to the story of Yugoslavia. This valiant, steadfast people whose history for centuries has been a struggle for life, and who owe their survival to their mountains and to their fighting qualities, made every endeavour to placate the Nazi monster. If they had made common cause with the Greeks when the Greeks, having been attacked by Italy, hurled back the invaders, the complete destruction of the ItaliaG armies in Albania could certainly and swiftly have been achieved long before the German forces could have reached the theatre of war. And even in January and February of this year, this extraordinary military opportunity was still open. But the Government of Prince Paul, untaught by the fate of so many of the smaller countries of Europe, not only observed the strictest neutrality and refused even to enter into effective Staff conversations with Greece or with Turkey or with us, but hugged the delusion that they could preserve their independence by patching up some sort of pact or compromise with Hitler. Once again we saw the odious German poisoning technique employed. In this case, however, it was to the Government rather than to the nation that the doses and the inoculations were administered. The process was not hurried. Why should it have been? All the time the German armies and air force were massing in Bulgaria. From a few handfuls of tourists, admiring the beauty of the Bulgarian landscape in the wintry weather, the German forces grew to 7, 12, 20, and finally to 25 divisions. Presently, the weak and unfortunate Prince, and afterwards his Ministers, were summoned, like others before them, to Herr Hitler's footstool, and a pact was signed which would have given Germany complete control not only over the body but over the soul of the Slav nation. Then at last the people of Yugoslavia saw their peril, and with a universal spasm of revolt and national resurgence very similar to that which in 1808 convulsed and glorified the people of Spain, they swept from power those who were leading them into a shameful tutelage, and resolved at the eleventh hour to guard their freedom
and their honour with their lives. All this happened only a fortnight
ago.
A boa constrictor who had already covered his prey with his foul
saliva and then had it suddenly wrested from his coils, would be in
an amiable mood compared with Hitler, Goering, Ribbentrop and
the rest of the Nazi gang when they experienced this bitter
disappointment. A frightful vengeance was vowed against the
Southern Slavs. Rapid, perhaps hurried, redispositions were made of
the German forces and German diplomacy. Hungary was offered
large territorial gains to become the accomplice in the assault upon a
friendly neighbour with whom she had just signed a solemn pact of
friendship and non-aggression. Count Teleki preferred to take his
own life rather than join in such a deed of shame. A heavy forward
movement of the German armies already gathered in and dominating
Austria was set in motion through Hungary to the northern frontier
of Yugoslavia. A ferocious howl of hatred from the supreme
miscreant was the signa 1 for the actual invasion. The open city of
Belgrade was laid in ashes, and at the same time a tremendous drive
by the German armoured forces, which had been so improvidently
allowed to gather in Bulgaria, was launched westward into southern
Serbia. And as it was no longer worthwhile to keep up the farce of
love for Greece, other powerful forces rolled forward into Greece,
where they were at once unflinchingly encountered, and have alrady
sustained more than one bloody repulse at the hands of that heroic
Army. The British and Imperial troops have not up to the present
been engaged. Further than this I cannot, at the moment, go."
"Westward look; the land is bright', 27 April 1941, Broadcast, London",,"I was asked last week whether I was aware of some uneasiness which it was said existed in the country on account of the gravity, as it was described, of the war situation. So I thought it would be a good thing to go and see for myself what this 'uneasiness' amounted to, and I went to some of our great cities and seaports which had been most heavily bombed, and to some of the places where the poorest people had got it worst. I have come back not only reassured, but refreshed. To leave the offices of Whitehall with their ceaseless hum of activity and stress, and to go out to the front, by which I mean the streets and wharves of London or Liverpool, Manchester, Cardiff, Swansea or Bristol, is like going out of a hothouse on to the bridge of a fighting ship. It is a tonic which I should recommend any who are suffering from fretfulness to take in strong doses when they have need of it. It is quite true that I have seen many painful scenes of havoc, and of fine buildings and acres of cottage homes blasted into rubbleheaps of ruin. But it is just in those very places where the malice of the savage enemy has done its worst, and where the ordeal of the men, women and childrel1 has been most severe, that I found their morale most high and splendid. Indeed, I felt encompassed by an exaltation of spirit in the people which seemed to lift mankind and its troubles above the level of material facts into that joyous serenity we think belongs to a better world than this. Of their kindness to me I cannot speak, because I have never sought it or dreamed of it, and can never deserve it. I can only assure you that I and my colleagues, or comrades rather - for that is what they are - will toil with every scrap of life and strength, according to the lights that are granted to us, not to fail these people or be wholly unworthy of their faithful and generous regard. The British nation is stirred and moved as it has never been at any time in its long, eventful, famous history, and it is no hackneyed trope of speech to say that they mean to conquer or to die. What a triumph the life of these battered cities is, over the worst that fire and bomb can do. What a vindication of the civilised and decent way of living we have been trying to work for and work towards in our Island. What a proof of the virtues of free institutions. What a test of the quality of our local authorities, and of institutions and customs and societies so steadily built. This ordeal by fire has even in a certain sense exhilarated the manhood and womanhood of Britain. The sublime but also terrible and sombre experiences and emotions of the battlefield which for centuries had been reserved for the soldiers and sailors, are now shared, for good or ill, by the entire population. All are proud to be under the fire of the enemy. Old men, little children, the crippled veterans of former wars, aged women, the
ordinary hard-pressed citizen or subject of the King, as he likes to call
himself, the sturdy workmen who swing the hammers or load the
ships; skilful craftsmen; the members of every kind of ARP service,
are proud to feel that they stand in the line together with our fighting
men, when one of the greatest of causes is being fought out, as fought
out it will be, to the end. This is indeed the grand heroic period of
our history, and the light of glory shines on all.
You may imagine how deeply I feel my own responsibility to all
these people; my responsibility to bear my part in bringing them
safely out of this long, stern, scowling valley through which we are
marching, and not to demand from them their sacrifices and
exertions in vain.
I have thought in this difficult period, when so much fighting and
so many critical and complicated manoeuvres are going on, that it is
above all things important that our policy and conduct should be
upon the highest level, and that honour should be our guide. Very
few people realise how small were the forces with which General
Wavell, that fine Commander whom we cheered in good days and
will back through bad - how small were the forces which took the
bulk of the Italian masses in Libya prisoners. In none of his
successive victories could General Wavell maintain in the desert or
bring into action more than two divisions, or about 30,000 men.
When we reached Benghazi, and what was left of Mussolini's legions
scurried back along the dusty road to Tripoli, a call was made upon
us which we could not r~sist. Let me tell you about that call.
You will remember how in November the Italian Dictator fell
upon the unoffending Greeks, and without reason and without
warning invaded their country, and how the Greek nation, reviving
their classic fame, hurled his armies back at the double-quick.
Meanwhile Hitler, who had been creeping and worming his way
steadily forward, doping and poisoning and pinioning, one after the
other, Hungary, Rumania and Bulgaria, suddenly made it clear that
he would come to the rescue of his fellow-criminal. The lack of unity
among the Balkan States had enabled him to build up a mighty army
in their midst. While nearly all the Greek troops were busy beating
the Italians, the tremendous German military machine suddenly
towered up on their other frontier. In their mortal peril the Greeks
turned to us for succour. Strained as were our own resources, we
could not say them nay. By solemn guarantee given before the war,
Great Britain had promised them her help. They declared they would
fight for their native soil even if neither of their neighbours made common cause with them, and even if we left them to their fate. But
we could not do that. There are rules against that kind of thing; and
to break those rules would be fatal to the honour of the British
Empire, without which we could neither hope nor deserve to win this
hard war. Military defeat or miscalculation can be redeemed. The
fortunes of war are fickle and changing. But an act of shame would
deprive us of the respect which we now enjoy throughout the world,
and this would sap the vitals of our strength.
During the last year we have gained by our bearing and conduct a
potent hold upon the sentiments of the people of the United States.
Never, never in our history, have we been held in such admiration
and regard across the Atlantic Ocean. In that great Republic, now in
much travail and stress of soul, it is customary to use all the many
valid, solid arguments about American interests and American safety,
which depend upon the destruction of Hitler and his foul gang and
even fouler doctrines. But in the long run - believe me, for I know -
the action of the United States will be dictated, not by methodical
calculations of profit and loss, bllt by moral sentiment, and by that
gleaming flash of resolve which lifts the hearts of men and nations,
and springs from the spiritual foundations of human life itself.
We, for our part, were of course bound to hearken to the Greek
appeal to the utmost limit of our strength. We put the case to the
Dominions of Australia ana New Zealand, and their Governments,
without in any way ignoring the hazards, told us that they felt the
same as we did. So an important part of the mobile portion of the
Army of the Nile was sent to Greece in fulfilment of our pledge. It
happened that the divisions available and best suited to this task
were from New Zealand and Australia, and that only about half the
troops who took part in this dangerous expedition came from the
Mother Country. I see the German propaganda is trying to make bad
blood between us and Australia by making out that we have used
them to do what we would not have asked of the British Army. I
shall leave it to Australia to deal with that taunt.
Let us see what has happened. We knew, of course, that the forces
we could send to Greece would not by themselves alone be sufficient
to stem the German tide of invasion. But there was a very real hope
that the neighbours of Greece would by our intervention be drawn to
stand in the line together with her while time remained. How nearly
that came off will be known some day. The tragedy of Yugoslavia
has been that these brave people had a government who hoped to
purchase an ignoble immunity by submission to the Nazi will. Thus
when at last the people of Yugoslavia found out where they were being taken, and rose in one spontaneous surge of revolt, they saved
the soul and future of their country: but it was already too late to
save its territory. They had no time to mobilise their armies. They
were struck down by the ruthless and highly-mechanised Hun before
they could even bring their armies into the field. Great disasters have
occurred in the Balkans. Yugoslavia has been beaten down. Only in
the mountains can she continue her resistance. The Greeks have been
overwhelmed. Their victorious Albanian army has been cut off and
forced to surrender, and it has been left to the Anzacs and their
British comrades to fight their way back to the sea, leaving their
mark on all who hindered them.
I turn aside from the stony path we have to tread, to indulge a
moment of lighter relief. I daresay you have read in the newspapers
that, by a special proclamation, the Italian Dictator has congratulated the Italian army in Albania on the glorious laurels they have
gained by their victory over the Greeks. Here surely is the world's
record in the domain of the ridiculous and the contemptible. This
whipped jackal, Mussolini, wha to save his own skin has made all
Italy a vassal state of Hitler's Empire comes frisking up at the side of
the German tiger with yelpings not only of appetite - that can be
understood - but even of triumph. Different things strike different
people in different ways. But I am sure there are a great many
millions in the British Empire and in the United States, who will find
a new object in life in making sure that when we come to the final
reckoning this absurd impostor will be abandoned to public justice
and universal scorn.
While these grievous events were taking place in the Balkan
Peninsula and in Greece, our forces in Libya have sustained a
vexatious and damaging defeat. The Germans advanced sooner and
in greater strength than we or our Generals expected. The bulk of
our armoured troops, which had played such a decisive part in
beating the Italians, had to be refitted, and the single armoured
brigade which had been judged sufficient to hold the frontier till
about the middle of May was worsted and its vehicles largely
destroyed by a somewhat stronger German armoured force. Our
Infantry, which had not exceeded one division, had to fall back upon
the very large Imperial armies that have been assembled and can be
nourished and maintained in the fertile delta of the Nile.
T obruk - the fortress of T obruk - which flanks any German
advance on Egypt, we hold strongly. There we have repulsed many
attacks, causing the enemy heavy losses and taking many prisoners.
That is how the matter stands in Egypt and on the Libyan front. We must now expect the war in the Mediterranean on the sea, in
the desert, and above all in the air, to become very fierce, varied and
widespread. We had cleaned the Italians out of Cyrenaica, and it
now lies with us to purge that province of the Germans. That will be
a harder task, and we cannot expect to do it at once. You know I
never try to make out that defeats are victories. I have never
underrated the German as a warrior. Indeed I told you a month ago
that the swift, unbroken course of victories which we had gained
over the Italians could hot possibly continue, and that misfortunes
must be expected. There is only one thing certain about war, that it is
full of disappointments and also full of mistakes. It remains to be
seen, however, whether it is the Germans who have made the mistake
in trampling down the Balkan States and in making a river of blood
and hate between themselves and the Greek and Yugoslav peoples. It
remains also to be seen whether they have made a mistake in their
attempt to invade Egypt with the forces and means of supply which
they have now got. Taught by experience, I make it a rule not to
prophesy about battles which have yet to be fought out. This,
however, I will venture to say, that I should be very sorry to see the
tasks of the combatants in the Middle East exchanged, and that
General Wavell's armies should be in the position of the German
invaders. That is only a personal opinion, and I can well understand
you may take a different view. It is certain that fresh dangers besides
those which threaten Egypt may come upon us in the Mediterranean.
The war may spread to Spain and Morocco. It may spread eastward
to Turkey and Russia. The Huns may lay their hands for a time upon
the granaries of the Ukraine and the oil-wells of the Caucasus. They
may dominate the Black Sea. They may dominate the Caspian. Who
can tell? We shall do our best to meet them and fight them wherever
they go. But there is one thing which is certain. There is one thing
which rises out of the vast welter which is sure and solid, and which
no one in his senses can mistake. Hitler cannot find safety from
avenging justice in the East, in the Middle East, or in the Far East. In
order to win this war, he must either conquer this Island by invasion,
or he must cut the ocean lifeline which joins us to the United States.
Let us look into these alternatives, if you will bear with me for a
few minutes longer. When I spoke to you last, early in February,
many people believed the Nazi boastings that the invasion of Britain
was about to begin. It has not begun yet, and with every week that
passes we grow stronger on the sea, in the air, and in the numbers,
quality, training and equipment of the great Armies that now guard
our Island. When I compare the position at home as it is today with what it was in the summer of last year, even after making allowance
for a much more elaborate mechanical preparation on the part of the
enemy, I feel that we have very much to be thankful for, and I believe
that, provided our exertions and our vigilance are not relaxed even
for a moment, we may be confident that we shall give a very good
account of ourselves. More than that it would be boastful to say.
Less than that it would be foolish to believe.
But how about our lifeline across the Atlantic? What is to happen
if so many of our merchant ships are sunk that we cannot bring in
the food we need to nourish our brave people? What if the supplies
of war materials and war weapons which the United States are
seeking to send us in such enormous quantities should in large part
be sunk on the way? What is to happen then? In February, as you
may remember, that bad man in one of his raving outbursts
threatened us with a terrifying increase in the numbers and activities
of his U-boats and in his air attack - not only on our Island but,
thanks to his use of French and Norwegian harbours, and thanks to
the denial to us of the Irish bases - upon our shipping far out into the
Atlantic. We have taken and are taking all possible measures to meet
this deadly attack, and we are now fighting against it with might and
main. That is what is called the Battle of the Atlantic, which in order
to survive we have got to win on salt water just as decisively as we
had to win the Battle of Britain last August and September in the air.
Wonderful exertions have been made by our Navy and Air Force;
by the hundreds of mine-sweeping vessels which with their marvellous appliances keep our ports clear in spite of all the enemy can do;
by the men who build and repair our immense fleets of merchant
ships; by the men who load and unload them; and need I say by the
officers and men of the Merchant Navy who go out in all weathers
and in the teeth of all dangers to fight for the life of their native land
and for a cause they comprehend and serve. Still, when you think
how easy it is to sink ships at sea and how hard it is to build them
and protect them, and when you remember that we have never less
than two thousand ships afloat and three or four hundred in the
danger zone; when you think of the great armies we are maintaining
and reinforcing in the East, and of the world-wide traffic we have to
carryon - when you remember all this, can you wonder that it is the
Battle of the Atlantic which holds the first place in the thoughts of
those upon whom rests the responsibility for procuring the victory?
It was therefore with indescribable relief that I learned of the
tremendous decisions lately taken by the President and people of the
United States. The American Fleet and flying boats have been ordered to patrol the wide waters of the Western Hemisphere, and to warn
the peaceful shipping of all nations outside the combat zone of the
presence of lurking U-boats or raiding cruisers belonging to the two
aggressor nations. We British shall therefore be able to concentrate
our protecting forces far more upon the routes nearer home, and to
take a far heavier toll of the U-boats there. I have felt for some time
that something like this was bound to happen. The President and
Congress of the United States, having newly fortified themselves by
contact with their electors, have solemnly pledged their aid to Britain
in this war because they deem our cause just, and because they know
their own interests and safety would be endangered if we were
destroyed. They are taxing themselves heavily. They have passed
great legislation. They have turned a large part of their gigantic
industry to making the munitions which we need. They have even
given us or lent us valuable weapons of their own. I could not believe
that they would allow the high purposes to which they have set
themselves to be frustrated and the products of their skill and labour
sunk to the bottom of the sea. U-boat warfare as conducted by
Germany is entirely contrary to international agreements freely
subscribed to by Germany only a few years ago. There is no effective
blockade, but only a merciless murder and marauding over wide,
indiscriminate areas utterly beyond the control of the German
seapower. When I said ten weeks ago: 'Give us the tools and we will
finish the job,' I meant, give them to us: put them within our reachand that is what it now seems the Americans are going to do. And
that is why I feel a very strong conviction that though the Battle of
the Atlantic will be long and hard, and its issue is by no means yet
determined, it has entered upon a more grim but at the same time a
far more favourable phase. When you come to think of it, the United
States are very closely bound up with us now, and have engaged
themselves deeply in giving us moral, material, and, within the limits
I have mentioned, naval support.
It is worth while therefore to take a look on both sides of the ocean
at the forces which are facing each other in this awful struggle, from
which there can be no drawing back. No prudent and far-seeing man
can doubt that the eventual and total defeat of Hitler and Mussolini
is certain, in view of the respective declared resolves of the British
and American democracies. There are less than seventy million
malignant Huns - some of whom are curable and others killable -
many of whom are already engaged in holding down Austrians,
Czechs, Poles, French, and the many other ancient races they now
bully and pillage. The peoples of the British Empire and of the United States number nearly two hundred millions in their homelands and in
the British Dominions alone. They possess the unchallengeable
command of the oceans, and will soon obtain decisive superiority in
the air. They have more wealth, more technical resources, and they
make more steel, than the whole of the rest of the world put together.
They are determined that the cause of freedom shall not be trampled
down, nor the tide of world progress turned backwards, by the
criminal Dictators.
While therefore we naturally view with sorrow and anxiety much
that is happening in Europe and in Africa, and may happen in Asia,
we must not lose our sense of proportion and thus become
discouraged or alarmed. When we face with a steady eye the
difficulties which lie before us, we may derive new confidence from
remembering those we have already overcome. Nothing that is
happening now is comparable in gravity with the dangers through
which we passed last year. Nothing that can happen in the East is
comparable with what is happening in the West.
Last time I spoke to you I quoted the lines of Longfellow which
President Roosevelt had written out for me in his own hand. I have
some other lines which are less well known but which seem apt and
appropriate to our fortunes tonight, and I believe they will be so
judged wherever the English language is spoken or the flag of
freedom flies:
For while the tired waves, vainly breaking,
Seem here no painful inch to gain,
Far back, through creeks and inlets making,
Comes silent, flooding in, the main.
And not by eastern windows only,
When daylight comes, comes in the light;
In front the sun climbs slow, how slowly!
But westward, look, the land is bright."
"Vote of Confidence, 7 May 1941, House of Commons",,"This Debate, as I think will be agreed on all hands, has been marked
by a high sense of discretion and a high degree of responsibility in all
who have taken part in it. If there were any speech I could single out
especially for praise, it would, I think, be the last, to which we have
just listened. The Member for Derby [Mr Noel-Baker] is a great
devotee of the Greek cause, and all that he has said has shown how
deeply he has studied the articulation of their defences and, of course,
their fortunes. If there were any speech which I felt was not
particularly exhilarating, it was the speech of the Member for
Carnarvon Boroughs [Mr Lloyd George], who honoured us by one
of his always deeply important and much valued appearances in the
House ....
I must, however, say that I did not think Mr Lloyd George's speech
was particularly helpful at a period of what he himself called
discouragement and disheartenment. It was not the sort of speech
which one would have expected from the great war leader of former
days, who was accustomed to brush aside despondency and alarm,
and push on irresistibly towards the final goal. It was the sort of
speech with which, I imagine, the illustrious and venerable Marshal
Petain might well have enlivened the closing days of M. Reynaud's
Cabinet. But in one respect J am grateful to my right hon. Friend for the note which he struck, because if anything could make it clearer
that we ought to close our Debate by a Vote of Confidence, it is the
kind of speech which he delivered, and the kind of speeches we have
heard from some of the ablest and most eminent Members of the
House. I think the Government were right to put down a Motion of
Confidence, because after our reverses and disappointments in the
field, His Majesty's Government have a right to know where they
stand with the House of Commons, and where the House of
Commons stands with the country. Still more is this knowledge
important for the sake of foreign nations, especially nations which
are balancing their policy at the present time, and who ought to be
left in no doubt about the stability or otherwise of this resolved and
obstinate war Government. Questions are asked, conversations take
place in the Lobbies, paragraphs are written in the political columns
of the newspapers, and before you know where you are, you hear in
all the Embassies with which we are in relation queries, 'Will the
Government last? - Are they going to break up? - Will there be a
change of administration and a change of policy?'
I think it is essential, considering the tremendous issues which are
at stake, and, not to exaggerate, the frightful risks we are all going to
run, and are running, that we should have certitude on these matters.
In enemy countries they take a lively interest in our proceedings, and
I flatter myself that high hopes are entertained that all will not go
well with His Majesty's present advisers. The only way in which
these doubts can be removed and these expectations disappointed is
by a full Debate followed by a Division, and the Government are
entitled to ask that such a Vote shall express itself in unmistakable
terms. I see that one of the newspapers, which is described as a
supporter of the Government, and which supports us by being the
most active in keeping us up to the mark - like the Noble Lord the
Member for Horsham [Earl Winterton], now relieved from all
necessity of keeping himself up to the mark - has deplored the fact of
this Motion of Confidence being proposed, because such a procedure
might lead some Members to make speeches in favour of the
Government, whereas it would be much more useful if the Debate
consisted entirely of informative criticism. I am not one, and I should
be the last, unduly to resent unfair criticism, or even fair criticism,
which is so much more searching. I have been a critic myself - I
cannot at all see how I should have stood the test of being a mere
spectator in the drama which is now passing. But there is a kind of
criticism which is a little irritating. It is like that of a bystander who,
when he sees a team of horses dragging a heavy wagon painfully up a hill, cuts a switch from the fence, and there are many switches, and
belabours them lustily. He may well be animated by a benevolent
purpose, and who shall say the horses may not benefit from his
efforts, and the wagon get quicker to the top of the hill?
I think that it would be a pity if this important and critical Debate
at this moment which my right hon. Friend describes as disheartening
and discouraging, consisted solely of critical and condemnatory
speeches, because, apart from the inartistic monotony, it would tend
to give a distorted impression to many important and interested
foreign observers who are not very well acquainted with our
Parliamentary or political affairs. Therefore I ask the House for a
Vote of Confidence. I hope that those, if such there be, who sincerely
in their hearts believe that we are not doing our best and that they
could do much better, I hope that they will carry their opinion to its
logical and ultimate conclusion in the Lobby. Here I must point out,
only for the benefit of foreign countries, that they would run no risk
in doing so. They are answerable only to their consciences and to
their constituents. It is a free Parliament in a free country. We have
succeeded in maintaining, under difficulties which are unprecedented, and in dangers which, in some cases, might well be mortal,
the whole process and reality of Parliamentary institutions. I am
proud of this. It is one of the things for which we are fighting.
Moreover, I cannot imagine that any man would want to bear, or
consent to bear, the kind of burden which falls upon the principal
Ministers in the Government, or upon the head of the Government in
this terrible war, unless he were sustained, and continually sustained,
by strong convinced support, not only of the House of Commons,
but of the nation to which the House of Commons is itself
responsible.
It is very natural that the House should not be entirely satisfied
with the recent turn of events in the Middle East, and that some
Members should be acutely disappointed that we have not been able
to defend Greece successfully against the Italian or German armies,
and that we should have been unable to keep or extend our
conquests in Libya. This sudden darkening of the landscape, after we
had been cheered by a long succession of victories over the Italians, is
particularly painful. For myself, I must confess that I watched the
fate of Greece, after her repulse of the Italian invader, with agony.
The only relief I feel is that everything in human power was done by
us and that our honour as a nation is clear. If anything could add a
pang to this emotion, it would be the knowledge we had of the
approaching and impending outrage, with so little power to avert from this heroic and famous people a fate so hideous and so
undeserved ....
My right hon. Friend the Member of Devonport [Mr HoreBelisha], who is so far-seeing now that we have lost his services and
who told us at the end of November, 1939, that we were
comfortably winning the war, had the temerity yesterday to raise the
subject of our admitted shortage of tanks. There is one very simple
point about tanks, which I think he might have mentioned to us, in
the years preceding the war when he was at the head of the War
Office and had the opportunity of the highest technical advice. In the
last war, tanks were built to go three or four miles an hour and to
stand up to rifle or machine-gun bullets. In the interval the process of
mechanical science had advanced so much that it became possible to
make a tank which could go 15,20 or 25 miles an hour and stand up
to cannon fire. That was a great revolution, by which Hitler has
profited. That is a simple fact which was perfectly well known to the
military and technical services three or four years before the war. It
did not spring from G~rman brains. It sprang from British brains,
and from brains like those of General de Gaulle in France, and it has
been exploited and turned to our grievous injury by the uninventive
but highly competent and imitative Germans. The British Tank
Corps knew all about it and wrote it down, but apparently my right
han. Friend did not take it in - at any rate, he did not mention it to
us in those simple terms, and, indeed, it may be that the point may
not have struck him until now. It would have been a very valuable
contribution to our pre-war preparations. My right han. Friend
played a worthy part in bringing in compulsory service. I should not
have referred to this matter if he had not endeavoured to give the
House a sort of idea of his super-prevision and super-efficiency and
shown himself so aggressive when, I think, with all goodwill, he
sometimes stands in need of some humility in regard to the past.
Let me tell him that we are now making every month as many
heavy tanks as there existed in the whole British Army at the time he
left the War Office - and that we shall very soon, before the end of
this year, be producing nearly double that number. This takes no
account of the immense productive efforts in the United States. I only
say this to him by way of reassuring him that the good work which
he did, the foundations which he laid, have not been left to stand
where they were when he went out of office. He must learn to
'forgive us our trespass~s as we forgive them that trespass against us.'
My right hon. Friend the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs [Mr
Lloyd George] made his usual criticisms about the composition and character of the Government, of the war control and of the War
Cabinet, and the House is entitled to know, has a right to know, who
are responsible for the conduct of the war. The War Cabinet consists
of eight members, five of whom have no regular Department, and
three of whom represent the main organisms of the State, to wit,
Foreign Affairs, Finance and Labour, which in their different ways
come into every great question that has to be settled. That is the body
which gives its broad sanction to the main policy and conduct of the
war. Under their authority, the Chiefs of Staff of the three Services sit
each day together, and I, as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence,
convene them and preside over them when I think it necessary,
inviting, when business requires it, the three Service Ministers. All
large issues of military policy are brought before the Defence
Committee, which has for several months consisted of the three
Chiefs of Staff, the three Service Ministers, and four members of the
War Cabinet, namely, myself, the Lord Privy Seal, who has no
Department, the Foreign Secretary, and Lord Beaverbrook. This is
the body, this is the machine; it works easily and flexibly at the
present time, and I do not propose to make any changes in it until
further advised.
My right han. Friend spoke of the great importance of my being
surrounded by people who would stand up to me and say, 'No, No,
No.' Why, good gracious, has he no idea how strong the negative
principle is in the constitution and working of the British warmaking machine? The difficulty is not, I assure him, to have more
brakes put on the wheels; the difficulty is to get more impetus and
speed behind it. At one moment we are asked to emulate the
Germans in their audacity and vigour, and the next moment the
Prime Minister is to be assisted by being surrounded by a number of
'No-men' to resist me at every point and prevent me from making
anything in the nature of a speedy, rapid and, above all, positive
constructive decision.
However, I must say that, in this whole business of Libya and
Greece, I can assure the House that no violence has been done to
expert military opinion, either in the Chiefs of Staff Committee at
home or in the generals commanding in the field. All decisions have
been taken unitedly and freely and in good will, in response to the
hard pressure of events. I would make it clear, however, that, in
certain circumstances or emergencies, the responsible political Minister representing the Government of the country would not hesitate to
assume responsibility for decisions which might have to be taken,
and I, personally, as head of the Government, obviously assume that responsibility in the most direct personal form. It follows, therefore,
when all is said and done, that I am the one whose head should be
cut off if we do not win the war. I am very ready that this should be
so, because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sea ham [Mr
Shinwell] feelingly reminded us yesterday, most of the Members of
the House would probably experience an even more unpleasant fate
at the hands of the triumphant Hun.
I notice a tendency in some quarters, especially abroad, to talk
about the Middle East as if we could afford to lose our position there
and yet carryon the war to victory on the oceans and in the air.
Stated as an academic and strategic fact, that may be true, but do not
let anyone underrate the gravity of the issues which are being fought
for in the Nile Valley. The loss of the Nile Valley and the Suez Canal
and the loss of our position in the Mediterranean, as well as the loss
of Malta, would be among the heaviest blows which we could
sustain. We are determined to fight for them with all the resources of
the British Empire, and we have every reason to believe that we shall
be successful. General Waveli has under his orders at the present
moment nearly 500,000 men ....
I ask you to witness, Mr Speaker, that I have never promised
anything or offered anything but blood, tears, toil and sweat, to
which I will now add our fair share of mistakes, shortcomings and
disappointments, and also that this may go on for a very long time,
at the end of which I firmly believe - though it is not a promise or a
guarantee, only a profession of faith - that there will be complete,
absolute and final victory ....
In some quarters of the House, or at any rate among some
Members, there is a very acute realisation of the gravity of our
problems and of our dangers. I have never underrated them. I feel we
are fightil1g for life and survival from day to day and from hour to
hour. But, believe me, Herr Hitler has his problems, too, and if we
only remain united and strive our utmost to increase our exertions,
and work like one great family, standing together and helping each
other, as 5,000,000 families in Britain are doing today under the fire
of the enemy, I cannot conceive how anyone can doubt that victory
will crown the good cause we serve. Government and Parliament
alike have to be worthy of the undaunted and unconquerable people
who give us their trust and who give their country their all.
It is a year almost to a day since, in the crash of the disastrous
Battle of France, His Majesty's present Administration was formed.
Men of all parties, duly authorised by their parties, joined hands
together to fight this business to the end. That was a dark hour, and little did we know what storms and perils lay before us, and little did
Herr Hitler know, when in June, 1940, he received the total
capitulation of France and when he expected to be master of all
Europe in a few weeks and the world in a few years, that ten months
later, in May, 1941, he would be appealing to the much-tried
German people to prepare th~mselves for the war of 1942. When I
look back on the perils which have been overcome, upon the great
mountain waves through which the gallant ship has driven, when I
remember all that has gone wrong, and remember also all that has
gone right, I feel sure we have no need to fear the tempest. Let it roar,
and let it rage. We shall come through."
"The Bismarck is sunk!', 27 May 1941, House of Commons",,"On Wednesday of last week, 21st May, the new German battleship, the Bismarck, accompanied by the new 8-in. gun cruiser Prince Eilg:,/z, was discovered by our air reconnaissance at Bergen, and on T::..:.:-sday, 22nd May, it was known that they had left. Many a:-:- ~;:g:ements were made to intercept them should they attempt, as see:-:-:.e.:! probable, to break out into the Atlantic Ocean with a view to sl~i;"":~n§: at our convoys from the United States. During the night of 23rc to 24th our cruisers got into visual contact with them as they \\'ere passing through the Denmark Strait between Iceland and Greenland. At dawn on Saturday morning the Prince of Wales and the Hood intercepted the two enemy vessels. I have no detailed
account of the action, because events have been moving so rapidly,
but the Hood was struck at about 23,000 yards by a shell which
penetrated into one of her magazines, and blew up, leaving only very
few survivors. This splendid vessel, designed 23 years ago, is a
serious loss to the Royal Navy, and even more so are the men and
officers who manned her.
During the whole of Saturday our ships remained in touch with the
Bismarck and her consort. In the night aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm
from the Victorious struck the Bismarck with a torpedo, and
arrangements were made for effective battle at dawn yesterday
morning; but as the night wore on the weather deteriorated, the
visibility decreased, and the Bismarck, by making a sharp turn,
shook off the pursuit. I do not know what has happened to the
Prince Eugen, but measures are being taken in respect of her.
Yesterday, shortly before midday, a Catalina aircraft - one of the
considerable number of these very far-ranging scouting aeroplanes
which have been sent to us by the United States - picked up the
Bismarck, and it was seen that she was apparently making for the
French ports - Brest or Saint Nazaire. On this, further rapid
dispositions were made by the Admiralty and by the Commander-inChief, and, of course, I may say that the moment the Bismarck was
known to be at sea the whole apparatus of our ocean control came
into play, very far-reaching combinations began to work, and from
yesterday afternoon - I have not had time to prepare a detailed
statement - Fleet Air Arm torpedo-carrying seaplanes from the Ark
Royal made a succession of attacks upon the Bismarck, which now
appears to be alone and without her consort. About midnight we
learned that the Bismarck had been struck by two torpedoes, one
amidships and the other astern. This second torpedo apparently
affected the steering of the ship, for not only was she reduced to a
very slow speed, but she continued making uncontrollable circles in
the sea. While in this condition she was attacked by one of our
flotillas, and hit by two more torpedoes, which brought her virtually
to a standstill, far from help and far outside the range at which the
enemy bomber aircraft from the French coast could have come upon
the scene. This morning, at daylight or shortly after daylight, the
Bismarck was attacked by the British pursuing battleships. I do not
know what were the results of the bombardment; it appears,
however, that the Bismarck was not sunk by gunfire, and she will
now be dispatched by torpedo. It is thought that this is now proceeding, and it is also thought that there cannot be any lengthy
delay in disposing of this vessel.
Great as is our loss in the Hood, the Bismarck must be regarded as
the most powerful, as she is the newest, battleship in the world; and
this striking of her from the German Navy is a very definite
simplification of the task of maintaining the effective mastery of the
Northern seas and the maintenance of the Northern blockade. I
daresay that in a few days it will be possible to give a much more
detailed account, but the essentials are before the House, and
although there is shade as well as light in this picture, I feel that we
have every reason to be satisfied with the outcome of this fierce and
memorable naval encounter.
[Later.] I do not know whether I might venture, with great respect,
to intervene for one moment. I have just received news that the
Bismarck is sunk. "
"Our solid; stubborn strength', 12 June 1941, London",,"In the twenty-second month of the war against Nazism we meet here in this old Palace of St James's, itself not unscarred by the fire of the enemy, in order to proclaim the high purposes and resolves of the lawful constitutional Governments of Europe whose countries have been overrun; and we meet here also to cheer the hopes of free men and free peoples throughout the world. Here before us on the table lie the title-deeds of ten nations or States whose soil has been invaded and polluted, and whose men, women, and children lie prostrate or writhing under the Hitler yoke. But here also, duly authorised by the Parliament and democracy of Britain, are gathered the servants of the ancient British Monarchy and the accredited representatives of the British Dominions beyond the seas, of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, of the Empire of India, of Burma, and of our Colonies in every quarter of the globe. They have drawn their swords in this cause. They will never let them fall till life is gone or ,-ictory is won. Here we meet, while from across the Atlantic Ocean the hammers and lathes of the United States signal in a rising hum
their message of encouragement and their promise of swift and evergrowing aid.
What tragedies, what hO[fors, what crimes have Hitler and all that
Hitler stands for brought upon Europe and the world! The ruins of
Warsaw, of Rotterdam, of Belgrade are monuments which will long
recall to future generations the outrage of the unopposed airbombing applied with calculated scientific cruelty to helpless populations. Here in London and throughout the cities of our Island, and in
Ireland, there may also be seen the marks of devastation. They are
being repaid, and presently they will be more than repaid.
But far worse than these visible injuries is the misery of the
conquered peoples. We see them hounded, terrorised, exploited.
Their manhood by the million is forced to work under conditions
indistinguishable in many cases from actual slavery. Their goods and
chattels are pillaged, or filched for worthless money. Their homes,
their daily life are pried into and spied upon by the all-pervading
system of secret political police which, having reduced the Germans
themselves to abject docility, now stalk the streets and byways of a
dozen lands. Their religious faiths are affronted, persecuted, or
oppressed in the interests of a fantastic paganism devised to
perpetuate the worship and sustain the tyranny of one abominable
creature. Their traditions, their culture, their laws, their institutions,
social and political alike, are suppressed by force or undermined by
subtle, coldly-planned intrigue.
The prisons of the Continent no longer suffice. The concentration
camps are overcrowded. Every dawn the German volleys crack.
Czechs, Poles, Dutchmen, Norwegians, Yugoslavs and Greeks,
Frenchmen, Belgians, Luxembourgers, make the great sacrifice for
faith and country. A vile race of quislings - to use the new word
which will carry the scorn of mankind down the centuries - is hired
to fawn upon the conqueror, to collaborate in his designs, and to
enforce his rule upon their fellow-countrymen, while grovelling low
themselves. Such is the plight of once glorious Europe, and such are
the atrocities against which we are in arms.
It is upon this foundation that Hitler, with his tattered lackey
Mussolini at his tail and Admiral Darlan frisking by his side,
pretends to build out of hatred, appetite, and racial assertion a new
order for Europe. Never did so mocking a fantasy obsess the mind of
mortal man. We cannot tell what the course of this fell war will be as
it spreads remorselessly through ever-wider regions. We know it will
be hard, we expect it will be long; we cannot predict or measure its episodes or its tribulations. But one thing is certain, one thing is sure,
one thing stands out stark and undeniable, massive and unassailable,
for all the world to see.
It will not be by German hands that the structure of Europe will be
rebuilt or the union of the European family achieved. In every
country into which the German armies and the Nazi police have
broken there has sprung up from the soil a hatred of the German
name and a contempt for the Nazi creed which the passage of
hundreds of years will not efface from human memory. We cannot
yet see how deliverance will come, or when it will come, but nothing
is more certain than that every trace of Hitler's footsteps, every stain
of his infected and corroding fingers will be sponged and purged and,
if need be, blasted from the surface of the earth.
We are here to affirm and fortify our union in that ceaseless and
unwearying effort which must be made if the captive peoples are to
be set free. A year ago His Majesty's Government was left alone to
face the storm, and to many of our friends and enemies alike it may
have seemed that our days too were numbered, and that Britain and
its institutions would sink for ever beneath the verge. But I may with
some pride remind your Excellencies that, even in that dark hour
when our Army was disorganised and almost weaponless, when
scarcely a gun or a tank remained in Britain, when almost all our
stores and ammunitions had been lost in France, never for one
moment did the British people dream of making peace with the
conqueror, and never for a moment did they despair of the common
cause. On the contrary, we proclaimed at that very time to all men,
not only to ourselve~, our determination not to make peace until
everyone of the ravaged and enslaved countries was liberated and
until the Nazi domination was broken and destroyed.
See how far we have travelled since those breathless days of June a
year ago. Our solid, stubborn strength has stood the awful test. We
are masters of our own air, and now reach out in ever-growing
retribution upon the enemy. The Royal Navy holds the seas. The
Italian fleet cowers diminished in harbour, the German Navy is
largely crippled or sunk. The murderous raids upon our ports, cities,
and factories have been powerless to quench the spirit of the British
nation, to stop our national life, or check the immense expansion of
our war industry. The food and arms from across the oceans are
coming safely in. Full provision to replace all sunken tonnage is being
made here, and still more by our friends in the United States. We are
becoming an armed community. Our land forces are being perfected
in equipment and training. Hitler may turn and trample this way and that through tortured
Europe. He may spread his course far and wide, and carry his curse
with him: he may break into Africa or into Asia. But it is here, in this
island fortress, that he will have to reckon in the end. We shall strive
to resist by land and sea. We shall be on his track wherever he goes.
Our air power will continue to teach the German homeland that war
is not all loot and triumph.
We shall aid and stir the people of every conquered country to
resistance and revolt. We shall break up and derange every effort
which Hitler makes to systematise and consolidate his subjugation.
He will find no peace, no rest, no halting-place, no parley. And if,
driven to desperate hazards, he attempts the invasion of the British
Isles, as well he may, we shall not flinch from the supreme trial. With
the help of God, of which we must all feel daily conscious, we shall
continue steadfast in faith and duty till our task is done.
This, then, is the message which we send forth today to all the
States and nations, bond or free, to all the men in all the lands who
care for freedom's cause, to our allies and well-wishers in Europe, to
our American friends and helpers drawing ever closer in their might
across the ocean: this is the message - Lift up your hearts. All will
come right. Out of the depths of sorrow and sacrifice will be born
again the glory of mankind."
"The Old Lion', 16 June 1941, Broadcast, London",,"I am grateful, President Valentine, for the honour which you have conferred upon me in making me a Doctor of Laws of Rochester University in the State of New York. I am extremely complimented by the expressions of praise and commendation in which you have addressed me, not because I am or ever can be worthy of them, but because they are an expression of American confidence and affection
which I shall ever strive to deserve.
But what touches me most in this ceremony is that sense of kinship
and of unity which I feel exists between us this afternoon. As I speak
from Downing Street to Rochester University and through you to the
people of the United States, I almost feel I have the right to do so,
because my mother, as you have stated, was born in your city, and
here my grandfather, Leonard Jerome, lived for so many years,
conducting as a prominent and rising citizen a newspaper with the
excellent eighteenth-century title of the Plain Dealer.
The great Burke has truly said, 'People will not look forward to
posterity who never look backward to their ancestors,' and I feel it
most agreeable to recall to you that the Jeromes were rooted for
many generations ire American soil, and fought in Washington's
armies for the independence of the American Colonies and the
foundation of the United States. I expect I was on both sides then.
And I must say I feel on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean now.
At intervals during the last forty years I have addressed scores of
great American audiences in almost every part of the Union. I have
learnt to admire the courtesy of these audiences; their sense of fair
play; their sovereign sense of humour, never minding the joke that is
turned against themselves; their earnest, voracious desire to come to
the root of the matter and to be well and truly informed on Old
World affairs.
And now, in this time of world storm, when I have been called
upon by King and Parliament and with the support of all parties in
the State to bear the chief responsibility in Great Britain, and when I
have had the supreme honour of speaking for the British nation in its
most deadly danger and in its finest hour, it has given me comfort
and inspiration to feel that I think as you do, that our hands are
joined across the oceans, and that our pulses throb and beat as one.
Indeed I will make so bold as to say that here at least, in my mother's
birth city of Rochester, I hold a latchkey to American hearts.
Strong tides of emotion, fierce surges of passion, sweep the broad
expanses of the Union in this year of fate. In that prodigious travail
there are many elemental forces, there is much heart-searching and
self-questioning; some pangs, some sorrow, some conflict of voices,
but no fear. The world is witnessing the birth throes of a sublime
resolve. I shall presume to confess to you that I have no doubts what
that resolve will be.
The destiny of mankind is not decided by material computation.
When great causes are on the move in the world, stirring all men's souls, drawing them from their firesides, casting aside comfort,
wealth and the pursuit of happiness in response to impulses at once
awe-striking and irresistible, we learn that we are spirits, not animals,
and that something is going on in space and time, and beyond space
and time, which, whether we like it or not, spells duty.
A wonderful story is unfolding before our eyes. How it will end we
are not allowed to know. But on both sides of the Atlantic we all feel,
I repeat, all, that we are a part of it, that our future and that of many
generations is at stake. We are sure that the character of human
society will be shaped by the resolves we take and the deeds we do.
We need not bewail the fact that we have been called upon to face
such solemn responsibilities. We may be proud, and even rejoice
amid our tribulations, that we have been born at this cardinal time
for so great an age and so splendid an opportunity of service here
below.
Wickedness, enormous, panoplied, embattled, seemingly triumphant, casts its shadow over Europe and Asia. Laws, customs and
traditions are broken up. Justice is cast from her seat. The rights of
the weak are trampled down. The grand freedoms of which the
President of the United States has spoken so movingly are spurned
and chained. The whole stature of man, his genius, his initiative and
his nobility, is ground rlown under systems of mechanical barbarism
and of organised and scheduled terror.
For more than a year we British have stood alone, uplifted by your
sympathy and respect and sustained by our own unconquerable willpower and by the increasing growth and hopes of your massive aid.
In these British Islands that look so small upon the map we stand, the
faithful guardians of the rights and dearest hopes of a dozen States
and nations now gripped and tormented in a base and cruel
servitude. Whatever happens we shall endure to the end.
But what is the explanation of the enslavement of Europe by the
German Nazi regime? How did they do it? It is but a few years ago
since one united gesture by the peoples, great and small, who are
now broken in the dust, would have warded off from mankind the
fearful ordeal it has had to undergo. But there was no unity. There
was no vision. The nations were pulled down one by one while the
others gaped and chattered. One by one, each in his turn, they let
themselves be caught. One after another they were felled by brutal
violence or poisoned from within by subtle intrigue.
And now the old lion with her lion cubs at her side stands alone
against hunters who are armed with deadly weapons and impelled by
desperate and destructive rage. Is the tragedy to repeat itself once more? Ah no! This is not the end of the tale. The stars in their courses
proclaim the deliverance of mankind. Not so easily shall the onward
progress of the peoples be barred. Not so easily shall the lights of
freedom die.
But time is short. Every month that passes adds to the length and
to the perils of the journey that will have to be made. United we
stand. Divided we fall. Divided, the dark age returns. United, we can
save and guide the world."
"Alliance with Russia, 22 June 1941, Broadcast, London",,"I have taken occasion to speak to you tonight because we have
reached one of the climacterics of the war. The first of these intense
turning-points was a year ago when France fell prostrate under the
German hammer, and when we had to face the storm alone. The
second was when the Royal Air Force beat the Hun raiders out of the
daylight air, and thus warded off the Nazi invasion of our island
while we were still ill-armed and ill-prepared. The third turning-point
was when the President and Congress of the United States passed the
Lease-and-Lend enactment, devoting nearly 2,000 millions sterling of
wealth of the New World to help us to defend our liberties and
their own. Those were the three climacterics. The fourth is now upon
us.
At four o'clock this morning Hitler attacked and invaded Russia.
All his usual formalities of perfidy were observed with scrupulous
technique. A non-aggression treaty had been solemnly signed and was in force between the two countries. No complaint had been
made by Germany of its non-fulfilment. Under its cloak of false
confidence, the German armies drew up in immense strength along a
line which stretches from the White Sea to the Black Sea; and their air
fleets and armoured divisions slowly and methodically took their
stations. Then, suddenly, without declaration of war, without even
an ultimatum, German bombs rained down from the air upon the
Russian cities, the German troops violated the frontiers; and an hour
later the German Ambassador, who till the night before was
lavishing his assurances of friendship, almost of alliance, upon the
Russians, called upon the Russian Foreign Minister to tell him that a
state of war existed between Germany and Russia.
Thus was repeated on a far larger scale the same kind of outrage
against every form of signed compact and international faith which
we have witnessed in Norway, Denmark, Holland and Belgium, and
which Hitler's accomplice, the jackal Mussolini, so faithfully imitated in the case of Greece.
All this was no <;urprisc to me. In fact I gave clear and precise
warnings to Stalin of what was coming. I gave him warning as I have
given warning to others before. I can only hope that this warning did
not fall unheeded. All we know at present is that the Russian people
are defending their native soil and that their leaders have called upon
them to resist to the utmost.
Hitler is a monster of wickedness, insatiable in his lust for blood
and plunder. Not content with having all Europe under his heel, or
else terrorised into various forms of abject submission, he must now
carry his work of butchery and desolation among the vast multitudes
of Russia and of Asia. The terrible military machine, which we and
the rest of the civilised world so foolishly, so supinely, so insensately
allowed the Nazi gangsters to build up year by year from almost
nothing, cannot stand idle lest it rust or fall to pieces. It must be in
continual motion, grinding up human lives and trampling down the
homes and the rights of hundreds of millions of men. Moreover it
must be fed, not only with flesh but with oil.
So now this bloodthirsty guttersnipe must launch his mechanised
armies upon new fields of slaughter, pillage and devastation. Poor as
are the Russian peasants, workmen and soldiers, he must steal from
them their daily bread; he must devour their harvests; he must rob
them of the oil which drives their ploughs; and thus produce a famine
without example in human history. And even the carnage and ruin
which his victory, should he gain it - he has not gained it yet - will
bring upon the Russian people, will itself be only a stepping-stone to the attempt to plunge the four or five hundred millions who live in
China, and the three hundred and fifty millions who live in India,
into that bottomless pit of human degradation over which the
diabolic emblem of the Swastika flaunts itself. It is not too much to
say here this summer evening that the lives and happiness of a
thousand million additional people are now menaced with brutal
Nazi violence. That is enough to make us hold our breath. But
presently I shall show you something else that lies behind, and
something that touches very nearly the life of Britain and of the
United States.
The Nazi regime is indistinguishable from the worst features of
Communism. It is devoid of all theme and principle except appetite
and racial domination. It excels all forms of human wickedness in the
efficiency of its cruelty and ferocious aggression. No one has been a
more consistent opponent of Communism than I have for the last
twenty-five years. I will unsay no word that I have spoken about it.
But all this fades away before the spectacle which is now unfolding.
The past with its crimes, its follies and its tragedies, flashes away. I
see the Russian soldier~ standing on the threshold of their native
land, guarding the fields which their fathers have tilled from time
immemorial. I see them guarding their homes where mothers and
wives pray - ah yes, for there are times when all pray - for the safety
of their loved ones, the return of the breadwinner, of their champion,
of their protector. I see the ten thousand villages of Russia, where the
means of existence was wrung so hardly from the soil, but where
there are still primordial human joys, where maidens laugh and
children play. I see advancing upon all this in hideous onslaught the
Nazi war machine, with its clanking, heel-clicking, dandified Prussian officers, its crafty expert agents fresh from the cowing and tyingdown of a dozen countries. I see also the dull, drilled, docile, brutish
masses of the Hun soldiery plodding on like a swarm of crawling
locusts. I see the German bombers and fighters in the sky, still
smarting from many a British whipping, delighted to find what they
believe is an easier and a safer prey.
Behind all this glare, behind all this storm, I see that small group of
villainous men who plan, organise and launch this cataract of
horrors upon mankind. And then my mind goes back across the
years to the days when the Russian armies were our allies against the
same deadly foe; when they fought with so much valour and
constancy, and helped to gain a victory from all share in which, alas,
they were - through no fault of ours - utterly cut off. I have lived through all this, and you will pardon me if I express my feelings and
the stir of old memories.
But now I have to declare the decision of His Majesty's
Government - and I feel sure it is a decision in which the great
Dominions will, in due course, concur - for we must speak out now
at once, without a day's delay. I have to make the declaration, but
can you doubt what our policy will be? We have but one aim and
one single, irrevocable purpose. We are resolved to destroy Hitler
and every vestige of the Nazi regime. From this nothing will turn usnothing. We will never parley, we will never negotiate with Hitler or
any of his gang. We shall fight him by land, we shall fight him by sea,
we shall fight him in the air, until with God's help we have rid the
earth of his shadow and liberated its peoples from his yoke. Any man
or state who fights on against Nazidom will have our aid. Any man
or state who marches with Hitler is our foe. This applies not only to
organised states but to all representatives of that vile race of quislings
who make themselves the tools and agents of the Nazi regime against
their fellow-countrymen and the lands of their birth. They - these
quislings - like the Nazi leaders themselves, if not disposed of by
their fellow-countrymen, which would save trouble, will be delivered
by us on the morrow of victory to the justice of the Allied tribunals.
That is our policy and that is our declaration. It follows, therefore,
that we shall give whatever help we can to Russia and the Russian
people. We shall appeal to all our friends and allies in every part of
the world to take the same course and pursue it, as we shall,
faithfully and steadfastly to the end.
We have offered the Government of Soviet Russia any technical or
economic assistance which is in our power, and which is likely to be
of service to them. We shall bomb Germany by day as well as by
night in ever-increasing measure, casting upon them month by month
a heavier discharge of bombs, and making the German people taste
and gulp each month a sharper dose of the miseries they have
showered upon mankind. It is noteworthy that only yesterday the
Royal Air Force, fighting inland over French territory, cut down with
very small loss to themselves 28 of the Hun fighting machines in the
air above the French soil they have invaded, defiled and profess to
hold. But this is only a beginning. From now forward the main
expansion of our Air Force proceeds with gathering speed. In another
six months the weight of the help we are receiving from the United
States in war materials of all kinds, and especially in heavy bombers,
will begin to tell.
This is no class war, but a war in which the whole British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations is engaged without distinction of
race, creed or party. It is not for me to speak of the action of the
United States, but this I will say: if Hitler imagines that his attack on
Soviet Russia will cause the slightest division of aims or slackening of
effort in the great Democracies who are resolved upon his doom, he
is woefully mistaken. On the contrary, we shall be fortified and
encouraged in our efforts to rescue mankind from his tyranny. We
shall be strengthened and not weakened in determination and in
resources.
This is no time to mora lise on the follies of countries and
governments which have allowed themselves to be struck down one
by one, when by united action they could have saved themselves and
saved the world from this catastrophe. But when I spoke a few
minutes ago of Hider's blood-lust and the hateful appetites which
have impelled or lured him on his Russian adventure, I said there was
one deeper motive behind his outrage. He wishes to destroy the
Russian power because he hopes that if he succeeds in this, he will be
able to bring back th~ main strength of his army and air force from
the East and hurl it upon this Island, which he knows he must
conquer or suffer the penalty of his crimes. His invasion of Russia is
no more than a prelude to an attempted invasion of the British Isles.
He hopes, no doubt, that all this may be accomplished before the
winter comes, and that he can overwhelm Great Britain before the
fleet and air power of the United States may intervene. He hopes that
he may once again repeat, upon a greater scale than ever before, that
process of destroying his enemies one by one, by which he has so
long thrived and prospered, and that then the scene will be clear for
the final act, without which all his conquests would be in vain -
namely, the subjugation of the Western Hemisphere to his will and to
his system.
The Russian danger is therefore our danger, and the danger of the
United States, just as the cause of any Russian fighting for his hearth
and home is the cause of free men and free peoples in every quarter
of the globe. Let us learn the lessons already taught by such cruel
experience. Let us redouble our exertions, and strike with united
strength while life and power remain. "
"'The grit and stamina of Londoners', 14 July 1941, County Hall, London",,"In September last, having been defeated in his invasion plans by the RAF, Hitler declared his intention to raze the cities of Britain to the ground, and in the early days of that month he set the whole fury of the Hun upon London. None of us quite knew what would be the result of a concentrated and prolonged bombardment of this vast centre of population. Here in the Thames Valley, over 8,000,000 people are maintained at a very high level of modern civilisation. They are dependent from day to day upon light, heat, power, water, sewerage, and communications on the most com!,licated scale. The administration of London in all its branches was confronted with problems hitherto unknown and unmeasured in all the history of the past. Public order, public health, the maintenance of all the essential services, the handling of the millions of people who came in and out of London every day; the shelter - not indeed from the enemy's bombs, for that was beyond us, but from their blast and splinters - the shelter of millions of men and women, and the removal of the dead and wounded from the shattered buildings; the care of the wounded w hen hospitals were being ruthlessly bombed, and the provision for the homeless - sometimes amounting to many thousands in a single day, and accumulating to many more after three or four days of successive attacks - all these things, with the welfare and the education amid these scenes of our great numbers of children here - all these presented tasks which, viewed in cold blood beforehand, might well have seemed overwhelming. Indeed, before the war, when the imagination painted pictures of what might happen in the great air raids on our cities, plans were made to move the Government, to move all the great controlling services which are centred in London, and disperse them about the countryside, and also it was always considered a very great danger that a sudden wave of panic might send millions of people crowding out into the countryside along all the roads. Well, when you are doing your duty and you are sure of that, you need not worry too much about the dangers or the consequences. We have not been moved in this war except by the promptings of duty
and conscience, and therefore we do not need to be deterred from
action by pictures which our imagination or careful forethought
painted of what the CO!lsequences would be.
I must, however, admit that when the storm broke in September, I
was for several weeks very anxious about the result. We were then
not prepared as we are now. Our defences had not the advantages
they have since attained, and again I must admit that I greatly feared
injury to our public services, I feared the ravages of fire, I feared the
dislocation of life and the stoppage of work, I feared epidemics of
serious disease or even pestilence among the crowds who took refuge
in our by no means completely constructed or well-equipped shelters.
I remember one winter evening travelling to a railway station -
which still worked - on my way north to visit troops. It was cold and
raining. Darkness had almost fallen on the blacked-out streets. I saw
everywhere long queues of people, among them hundreds of young
girls in their silk stockings and high-heeled shoes, who had worked
hard all day and were waiting for bus after bus, which came by
already overcrowded, in the hope of reaching their homes for the
night. When at that moment the doleful wail of the siren betokened
the approach of the German bombers, I confess to you that my heart
bled for London and the Londoners.
All this sort of thing went on for more than four months with
hardly any intermission. I used to hold meetings of my Ministerial
colleagues and members of the authorities concerned every week in
Downing Street in order to check up and see how we stood.
Sometimes the gas had failed over large areas - the only means of
cooking for great numbers of people; sometimes the electricity. There
were grievous complaints about the shelters and about conditions in
them. Water was cut off, railways were cut or broken, large districts
were destroyed by fire, 20,000 people were killed, and many more
thousands were wounded.
But there was one thing about which there was never any doubt.
The courage, the unconquerable grit and stamina of the Londoners
showed itself from the very outset. Without that all would have
failed. Upon that rock, all stood unshakeable. All the public services
were carried on, and all the intricate arrangements, far-reaching
details, involving the daily lives of so many millions, were carried
out, improvised, elaborated, and perfected in the very teeth of the
cruel and devastating storm ....
If the storm is to renew itself, London will be ready, London will
not flinch, London can take it again. We ask no favours of the enemy. We seek from them no
compunction. On the contrary, if tonight the people of London were
asked to cast their vote whether a convention should be entered into
to stop the bombing of all cities, the overwhelming majority would
cry, 'No, we will mete out to the Germans the measure, and more
than the measure, that they have meted out to us.' The people of
London with one voice would say to Hitler: 'You have committed
every crime under the sun. Where you have been the least resisted
there you have been the most brutal. It was you who began the
indiscriminate bombing. We remember Warsaw in the very first few
days of the war. We remember Rotterdam. We have been newly
reminded of your habits by the hideous massacre of Belgrade. We
know too well the bestial assault you are making upon the Russian
people, to whom our hearts go out in their valiant struggle. We will
have no truce or parley with you, or the grisly gang who work your
wicked will. You do your worst - and we will do our best.'"
"The Atlantic Charter, 24 August 1941, Broadcast, London",,"I thought you would like me to tell you something about the voyage
which I made across the ocean to meet our great friend, the President
of the United States. Exactly where we met is a secret, but I don't
think I shall be indiscreet if I go so far as to say that it was
'somewhere in the Atlantic'.
In a spacious, landlocked bay which reminded me of the West
Coast of Scotland, powerful American warships protected by strong
flotillas and far-ranging aircraft awaited our arrival, and, as it were, stretched out a hand to help us in. Our party arrived in the newest, or
almost the newest, British battleship, the Prince of Wales, with a
modern escort of British and Canadian destroyers, and there for
three days I spent my time in company, and I think I may say in
comradeship, with Mr Roosevelt; while all the time the chiefs of the
staff and the naval and military commanders both of the British
Empire and of the United States sat together in continual council.
President Roosevelt is the thrice-chosen head of the most powerful
state and community in the world. I am the servant of King and
Parliament at present charged with the principal direction of our
affairs in these fateful times, and it is my duty also to make sure, as I
have made sure, that anything I say or do in the exercise of my office
is approved and sustained by the whole British Commonwealth of
Nations. Therefore this meeting was bound to be important, because
of the enormous forces at present only partially mobilised but
steadily mobilising which are at the disposal of these two major
groupings of the human family: the British Empire and the United
States, who, fortunately for the progress of mankind, happen to
speak the same language, and very largely think the same thoughts,
or anyhow think a lot of the same thoughts.
The meeting was therefore symbolic. That is its prime importance.
It symbolises, in a form and manner which everyone can understand
in every land and in every clime, the deep underlying unities which
stir and at decisive moments rule the English-speaking peoples
throughout the world. Would it be presumptuous for me to say that
it symbolises something tven more majestic - namely, the marshalling of the good forces of the world against the evil forces which are
now so formidable and triumphant and which have cast their cruel
spell over the whole of Europe and a large part of Asia?
This was a meeting which marks for ever in the pages of history
the taking-up by the English-speaking nations, amid all this peril,
tumult and confusion, of the guidance of the fortunes of the broad
toiling masses in all the continents; and our loyal effort without any
clog of selfish interest to lead them forward out of the miseries into
which they have been plunged back to the broad highroad of
freedom and justice. This is the highest honour and the most glorious
opportunity which could ever have come to any branch of the human
race.
When one beholds how many currents of extraordinary and
terrible events have flowed together to make this harmony, even the
most sceptical person must have the feeling that we all have the
chance to play our part and do our duty in some great design, the end of which no mortal can foresee. Awful and horrible things are
happening in these days. The whole of Europe has been wrecked and
trampled down by the mechanical weapons and barbaric fury of the
Nazis; the most deadly instruments of war-science have been joined
to the extreme refinements of treachery and the most brutal
exhibitions of ruthlessness, and thus have formed a combine of
aggression the like of which has never been known, before which the
rights, the traditions, the characteristics and the structure of many
ancient honoured states and peoples have been laid prostrate and are
now ground down under the heel and terror of a monster. The
Austrians, the Czechs, the Poles, the Norwegians, the Danes, the
Belgians, the Dutch, the Greeks, the Croats and the Serbs, above all
the great French nation, have been stunned and pinioned. Italy,
Hungary, RumC!nia, Bulgaria have bought a shameful respite by
becoming the jackals of the tiger, but their situation is very little
different and will presently be indistinguishable from that of his
victims. Sweden, Spain and Turkey stand appalled, wondering which
will be struck down next.
Here, then, is the vast pit into which all the most famous states and
races of Europe have been flung and from which unaided they can
never climb. But all this did not satiate Adolf Hitler; he made a treaty
of non-aggression with Soviet Russia, just as he made one with
Turkey, in order to keep them quiet till he was ready to attack them,
and then, nine weeks ago today, without a vestige of provocation, he
hurled millions of soldiers, with all their apparatus, upon the
neighbour he had called his friend, with the avowed object of
destroying Russia and tearing her in pieces. This frightful business is
now unfolding day by day before our eyes. Here is a devil who, in a
mere spasm of his pride and lust for domination, can condemn two
or three millions, perhaps it may be many more, of human beings, to
speedy and violent death. 'Let Russia be blotted out - Let Russia be
destroyed. Order the armies to advance.' Such were his decrees.
Accordingly from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea, six or seven
millions of soldiers are locked in mortal struggle. Ah, but this time it
was not so easy.
This time it was not all one way. The Russian armies and all the
peoples of the Russian Republic have rallied to the defence of their
hearths and homes, For the first time Nazi blood has flowed in a
fearful torrent. Certainly 1,500,000, perhaps 2,000,000 of Nazi
cannon-fodder have bit the dust of the endless plains of Russia. The
tremendous battle rages along nearly 2,000 miles of front. The
Russians fight with magnificent devotion; not only that, our generals who have visited the Russian front line report with admiration the
efficiency of their military organisation and the excellence of their
equipment. The aggressor is surprised, startled, staggered. For the
first time in his experience mass murder has become unprofitable. He
retaliates by the most frightful cruelties. As his armies advance,
whole districts are being exterminated. Scores of thousands -literally
scores of thousands - of executions in cold blood are being
perpetrated by the German police-troops upon the Russian patriots
who defend their native soil. Since the Mongol invasions of Europe
in the sixteenth century, there has never been methodical, merciless
butchery on such a scale, or approaching such a scale. And this is but
the beginning. Famine and pestilence have yet to follow in the bloody
ruts of Hitler's tanks. We are in the presence of a crime without a
name.
But Europe is not the only continent to be tormented and
devastated by aggressions. For five long years the Japanese military
factions, seeking to emulate the style of Hitler and Mussolini, taking
all their posturing as if it were a new European revelation, have been
invading and harrying the 500,000,000 inhabitants of China.
Japanese armies have been wandering about that vast land in futile
excursions, carrying with them carnage, ruin and corruption and
calling it the 'Chinese Incident'. Now they stretch a grasping hand
into the southern seas of China; they snatch Indo-China from the
wretched Vichy French; they menace by their movements Siam;
menace Singapore, the ~ritish link with Australia; and menace the
Philippine Islands under the protection of the United States. It is
certain that this has got to stop. Every effort will be made to secure a
peaceful settlement. The United States are labouring with infinite
patience to arrive at a fair and amicable settlement which will give
Japan the utmost reassurance for her legitimate interests. We
earnestly hope these negotiations will succeed. But this I must say:
that if these hopes should fail we shall of course range ourselves
unhesitatingly at the side of the United States.
And thus we come back to the quiet bay somewhere in the Atlantic
where misty sunshine piays on great ships which carry the White
Ensign, or the Stars and Stripes. We had the idea, when we met there
- the President and I - that without attempting to draw up final and
formal peace aims, or war aims, it was necessary to give all peoples,
especially the oppressed and conquered peoples, a simple, rough-andready wartime statement of the goal towards which the British
Commonwealth and the United States mean to make their way, and thus make a way for others to march with them upon a road which
will certainly be painful, and may be long!
There are, however, two distinct and marked differences in this
joint declaration from the attitude adopted by the Allies during the
latter part of the last war; and no one should overlook them. The
United States and Great Britain do not now assume that there will
never be any more war again. On the contrary, we intend to take
ample precautions to prevent its renewal in any period we can foresee
by effectively disarming the guilty nations while remaining suitably
protected ourselves.
The second difference is this: that instead of trying to ruin German
trade by all kinds of additional trade barriers and hindrances as was
the mood of 1917, we have definitely adopted the view that it is not
in the interests 0f the world and of our two countries that any large
nation should be unprosperous or shut out from the means of
making a decent living for itself and its people by its industry and
enterprise. These are far-reaching changes of principle upon which all
countries should ponder. Above all, it was necessary to give hope and
the assurance of final victory to those many scores of millions of men
and women who are battling for life and freedom, or who are
already bent down under the Nazi yoke. Hitler and his confederates
have for some time past been adjuring, bullying and beseeching the
populations whom they have wronged and injured, to bow to their
fate, to resign themselves to their servitude, and for the sake of some
mitigations and indulgences, to 'collaborate' - that is the word - in
what is called the New Order in Europe.
What is this New Order which they seek to fasten first upon
Europe and if possible - for their ambitions are boundless - upon all
the continents of the globe? It is the rule of the Herrenvolk - the
master-race - who are to put an end to democracy, to parliaments, to
the fundamental freedoms and decencies of ordinary men and
women, to the historic rights of nations; and give them in exchange
the iron rule of Prussia, the universal goose-step, and a strict, efficient
discipline enforced upon the working class by the political police,
with the German concentration camps and firing parties, now so
busy in a dozen lands, always handy in the background. There is the
New Order.
Napoleon in his glory and his genius spread his Empire far and
wide. There was a time when only the snows of Russia and the white
cliffs of Dover with their guardian fleets stood between him and the
dominion of the world. Napoleon's armies had a theme: they carried
with them the surges of the French Revolution. Liberty, Equality and Fraternity - that was the cry. There was a sweeping away of outworn
medieval systems and aristocratic privilege. There was the land for
the people, a new code of law. Nevertheless, Napoleon's Empire
vanished like a dream. Bat Hitler, Hitler has no theme, naught but
mania, appetite and exploitation. He has, however, weapons and
machinery for grinding down and for holding down conquered
countries which are the product, the sadly perverted product, of
modern science.
The ordeals, therefore, of the conquered peoples will be hard. We
must give them hope; we must give them the conviction that their
sufferings and their resistances will not be in vain. The tunnel may be
dark and long, but at the end there is light. That is the symbolism
and that is the message of the Atlantic meeting. Do not despair, brave
Norwegians: your laad shall be cleansed not only from the invader
but from the filthy quislings who are his tools. Be sure of yourselves,
Czechs: your independence shall be restored. Poles, the heroism of
your people standing up to cruel oppressors, the courage of your
soldiers, sailors and airmen, shall not be forgotten: your country
shall live again and resume its rightful part in the new organisation of
Europe. Lift up your heads, gallant Frenchmen: not all the infamies
of Darlan and of Laval shall stand between you and the restoration
of your birthright. Tough, stout-hearted Dutch, Belgians, Luxembourgers, tormented, mishandled, shamefully castaway peoples of
Yugoslavia, glorious Greece, now subjected to the crowning insult of
the rule of the Italian jackanapes; yield not an inch! Keep your souls
clean from all contact with the Nazis; make them feel even in their
fleeting hour of brutish triumph that they are the moral outcasts of
mankind. Help is coming; mighty forces are arming on your behalf.
Have faith. Have hope. Deliverance is sure.
There is the signal which we have flashed across the water; and if it
reaches the hearts of those to whom it is sent, they will endure with
fortitude and tenacity their present misfortunes in the sure faith that
they, too, are still serving the common cause, and that their efforts
will not be in vain.
You will perhaps have noticed that the President of the United
States and the British representative, in what is aptly called the
'Atlantic Charter', have jointly pledged their countries to the final
destruction of the Nazi tyranny. That is a solemn and grave
undertaking. It must be made good; it will be made good. And, of
course, many practical arrangements to fulfil that purpose have been
and are being organised and set in motion.
The question has been asked: how near is the United States to war? There is certainly one man who knows the answer to that question. If
Hitler has not yet declared war upon the United States, it is surely not
out of his love for American institutions; it is certainly not because he
could not find a pretext. He has murdered half a dozen countries for
far less. Fear of immediately redoubling the tremendous energies now
being employed against him is no doubt a restraining influence. But
the real reason is, I am sure, to be found in the method to which he
has so faithfully adhered and by which he has gained so much.
What is that method? It is a very simple method. One by one: that
is his plan; that is his guiding rule; that is the trick by which he has
enslaved so large a portion of the world. Three and a half years ago I
appealed to my fellow-countrymen to take the lead in weaving
together a strong defensive union within the principles of the League
of Nations, a union of all the countries who felt themselves in evergrowing danger. But none would listen; all stood idle while Germany
rearmed. Czechoslovakia was subjugated; a French Government
deserted their faithful ally and broke a plighted word in that ally's
hour of need. Russia was cajoled and deceived into a kind of
neutrality or partnership, while the French Army was being annihilated. The Low Countries and the Scandinavian countries, acting
with France and Great Britain in good time, even after the war had
begun, might have :1ltered its course, and would have had, at any
rate, a fighting chance. The Balkan States had only to stand together
to save themselves from the ruin by which they are now engulfed. But
one by one they were undermined and overwhelmed. Never was the
career of crime made more smooth.
Now Hitler is striking at Russia with all his might, well knowing
the difficulties of geography which stand between Russia and the aid
which the Western Democracies are trying to bring. We shall strive
our utmost to overcome all obstacles and to bring this aid. We have
arranged for a conference in Moscow between the United States,
British and Russian authorities to settle the whole plan. No barrier
must stand in the way. But why is Hitler striking at Russia, and
inflicting and suffering himself or, rather, making his soldiers suffer,
this frightful slaughter? It is with the declared object of turning his
whole force upon the British Islands, and if he could succeed in
beating the life and the strength out of us, which is not so easy, then
is the moment when he will settle his account, and it is already a long
one, with the people of the United States and generally with the
Western Hemisphere. One by one, there is the process; there is the
simple, dismal plan which has served Hitler so well. It needs but one final successful application to make him the master of the world. I
am devoutly thankful that some eyes at least are fully opened to it
while time remains. I rejoiced to find that the President saw in their
true light and proportion the extreme dangers by which the
American people as well as the British people are now beset. It was
indeed by the mercy of God that he began eight years ago that revival
of the strength of the American Navy without which the New World
today would have to take its orders from the European dictators, but
with which the United States still retains the power to marshal her
gigantic strength, and in saving herself to render an incomparable
service to mankind.
We had a church parade on the Sunday in our Atlantic bay. The
President came on to the quarter-deck of the Prince of Wales, where
there were mingled together many hundreds of American and British
sailors and marines. The sun shone bright and warm while we all
sang the old hymns which are our common inheritance and which we
learned as children in our homes. We sang the hymn founded on the
psalms which John Hampden's soldiers sang when they bore his
body to the grave, and in which the brief, precarious span of human
life is contrasted with the immutability of Him to Whom a thousand
ages are but as yesterday, and as a watch in the night. We sang the
sailors' hymn 'For those in rerit' - and there are very many - 'on the
sea'. We sang 'Onward Christian Soldiers'. And indeed I felt that this
was no vain presumption, but that we had the right to feel that we
were serving a cause for the sake of which a trumpet has sounded
from on high.
When I looked upon that densely-packed congregation of fighting
men of the same language, of the same faith, of the same
fundamental laws and the same ideals, and now to a large extent of
the same interests, and certainly in different degrees facing the same
dangers, it swept across me that here was the only hope, but also the
sure hope, of saving the world from measureless degradation.
And so we came back across the ocean waves, uplifted in spirit,
fortified in resolve. Some American destroyers which were carrying
mails to the United States marines in Iceland happened to be going
the same way, too, so we made a goodly company at sea together.
And when we were right out in mid-passage one afternoon a noble
sight broke on the view. We overtook one of the convoys which
carry the munitions and supplies of the New World to sustain the
champions of freedom in the Old. The whole broad horizon seemed
filled with ships; seventy or eighty ships of all kinds and SIzes, arrayed in fourteen lines, each of which could have been drawn with
a ruler, hardly a wisp of smoke, not a straggler, but all bristling with
cannons and other precautions on which I will not dwell, and all
surrounded by their British escorting vessels, while overhead the farranging Catalina air-boats soared - vigilant, protecting eagles in the
sky. Then I felt that - hard and terrible and long drawn-out as this
struggle may be - we shall not be denied the strength to do our duty
to the end."
"'We are still captain of our souls', 9 September 1941, House of Commons",,"The magnificent resistance of the Russian Armies and the skilful
manner in which their vast front is being withdrawn in the teeth of
Nazi invasion make it certain that Hitler's hopes of a short war with
Russia will be dispelled. Already in three months he has lost more
German blood than was shed in any single year of the last war.
Already he faces the certainty of having to maintain his armies on the
whole front from the Arctic to the Black Sea, at the end of long,
inadequate, assailed and precarious lines of communication, through
all the severity of a Russian winter, with the vigorous counter-strokes
which may be expected from the Russian Armies. From the moment,
now nearly 80 days ago, when Russia was attacked, we have cast
about for every means of giving the most speedy and effective help to
our new Ally. I am not prepared to discuss the military projects
which have been examined. Such a discussion would be harmful to
our interests, both by what was said and by what was not said. Nor
will it be possible for anyone representing the Government to enter
upon any argument on such questions. In the field of supply more
can be said. I agreed with President Roosevelt upon the message
which was sent to Premier Stalin, the terms of which have already
been made public. The need is urgent, and the scale heavy. A
considerable part of the munition industry and the iron and steel
production of Russia has fallen into the hands of the enemy. On the
other hand, the Soviet Union disposes of anything from ten to fifteen
million soldiers, for nearly all of whom they have equipment and arms. To aid in the supply of these masses, to enable them to realise
their long-continuing force, and to organise the operation of their
supply, will be the task of the Anglo-American-Russian Conference ....
Thus far then have we travelled along the terrible road we chose at
the call of duty. The mood of Britain is wisely and rightly averse
from every form of shallow or premature exultation. This is no time
for boasts or glowing prophecies, but there is this - a year ago our
position looked forlorn and vvell nigh desperate to all eyes but our
own. Today we may say aloud before an awe-struck world, 'We are
still masters of our fate. We are still captain of our souls.'"
"Never give in!', 29 October 1941, Harrow School",,"Almost a year has passed since I came down here at your Head
Master's kind invitation in order to cheer myself and cheer the hearts
of a few of my friends by singing some of our own songs. The ten
months that have passed have seen very terrible catastrophic events in the world - ups and downs, misfortunes - but can anyone sitting
here this afternoon, this October afternoon, not feel deeply thankful
for what has happened in the time that has passed and for the very
great improvement in th~ position of our country and of our home?
Why, when I was here last time we were quite alone, desperately
alone, and we had been so for five or six months. We were poorly
armed. We are not so poorly armed today; but then we were very
poorly armed. We had the unmeasured menace of the enemy and
their air attack still beating upon us, and you yourselves had had
experience of this attack; and I expect you are beginning to feel
impatient that there has been this long lull with nothing particular
turning up!
But we must learn to be equally good at what is short and sharp
and what is long and tough. It is generally said that the British are
often better at the last. They do not expect to move from crisis to
crisis; they do not always expect that each day will bring up some
noble chance of war; but when they very slowly make up their minds
that the thing has to he done and the job put through and finished,
then, even if it takes months - if it takes years - they do it.
Another lesson I think we may take, just throwing our minds back
to our meeting here ten months ago and now, is that appearances are
often very deceptive, and as Kipling well says, we must ... meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same.
You cannot tell from appearances how things will go. Sometimes
imagination makes things out far worse than they are; yet without
imagination not much can be done. Those people who are imaginative see many more dangers than perhaps exist, certainly many more
than will happen; but then they must also pray to be given that extra
courage to carry this far-reaching imagination. But for everyone,
surely, what we have gone through in this period - I am addressing
myself to the School - surely from this period of ten months this is
the lesson: never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never - in
nothing, great or small, large or petty - never give in except to
convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force; never
yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. We stood
all alone a year ago, and to many countries it seemed that our
account was closed, we were finished. All this tradition of ours, our
songs, our School history, this part of the history of this country,
were gone and finished and liquidated. Very different is the mood today. Britain, other nations thought,
had drawn a sponge across her slate. But instead our country stood
in the gap. There was no flinching and no thought of giving in; and
by what seemed almost a miracle to those outside these Islands,
though we ourselves never doubted it, we now find ourselves in a
position where I say that we can be sure that we have only to
persevere to conquer.
You sang here a verse of a School Song; you sang that extra verse
written in my honour, which I was very greatly complimented by and
which you have repeated today. But there is one word in it I want to
alter - I wanted to do so last year, but I did not venture to. It is the
line -
Nor less we praise in darker days.
I have obtained the Head Master's permission to alter 'darker' to
'sterner':
Nor less we praise in sterner days.
Do not let us speak of darker days; let us speak rather of sterner
days. These are not dark days: these are great days - the greatest days
our country has ever lived; and we must all thank God that we have
been allowed, each of us according to our stations, to playa part in
making these days memorable in the history of our race. "
"The Lend-Lease Bill, 10 November 1941, Mansion House, London",,"This year our ancient Guildhall lies in ruins, our foreign affairs are shrunken, and almost the whole of Europe is prostrate under the Nazi tyranny. The war which Hitler began by invading Poland and which now engulfs the European continent has broken into the north-east of Africa; may well involve the greater part of Asia; nay, it may soon spread to the remaining portions of the globe. Nevertheless, in the your assumption of office with the time-honoured pageant of Lord
Mayor's Day, so I, who have the honour to be your guest, will
endeavour to play, though very briefly - for in wartime speeches
should be short - the traditional part assigned to those who hold my
office.
The condition of Europe is terrible in the last degree. Hitler's firing
parties are busy every day in a dozen countries. Norwegians,
Belgians, Frenchmen, Dutch, Poles, Czechs, Serbs, Croats, Slovenes,
Greeks, and above all in scale Russians, are being butchered by
thousands and by tens of thousands after they have surrendered,
while individual and mass executions in all the countries I have
mentioned have become a part of the regular German routine. The
world has been intensely stirred by the massacre of the French
hostages. The whole of France, with the exception of the small clique
whose public careers depend upon a German victory, has been united
in horror and indignation against this slaughter of perfectly innocent
people. Admiral Darlan's tributes to German generosity fall unseasonably at this mome~1t on French ears, and his plans for loving
collaboration with the conquerors and the murderers of Frenchmen
are quite appreciably embarrassed. Nay, even the arch-criminal
himself, the Nazi ogre Hitler, has been frightened by the volume and
passion of world indignation which his spectacular atrocity has
excited. It is he and not the French people who have been
intimidated. He has not dared to go forward with his further
programme of killing hostages.
This, as you will have little doubt, is not due to mercy, to
compassion, to compunction, but to fear, and to a dawning
consciousness of personal insecurity rising in a wicked heart.
I would say generally that we must regard all these victims of the
Nazi executioners in so many lands, who are labelled Communists
and Jews - we must regard them just as if they were brave soldiers
who die for their country on the field of battle. Nay, in a way their
sacrifice may be more fruitful than that of the soldier who falls with
his arms in his hands. A river of blood has flowed and is flowing
between the German race and the peoples of nearly all Europe. It is
not the hot blood of battle where good blows are given and returned.
It is the cold blood of the execution yard and the scaffold, which
leaves a stain indelible for generations and for centuries.
Here then are the foundations upon which the New Order of
Europe is to be inaugurated. Here then is the house-warming festival
of the Herrenvolk. Here then is the system of terrorism by which the
Nazi criminals and their quisling accomplices seek to rule a dozen same spirit in which you, my Lord Mayor, have celebrated ancient famous States of Europe and if possible all the free nations of
the world. In no more effective manner could they have frustrated the
accomplishment of their own designs. The future and its mysteries
are inscrutable. But one thing is plain. Never to those blood-stained
accursed hands will the future of Europe be confided.
Since Lord Mayor's Day last year some great changes have taken
place in our situation. Then we were alone, the sole champion of
freedom. Then we were ill-armed and far outnumbered even in the
Air. Now a large part of the United States Navy, as Colonel Knox
has told us, is constantly in action against the common foe. Now the
valiant resistance of the Russian nation has inflicted most frightful
injuries upon the German military power, and at the present moment
the German invading armies, after all their losses, lie on the barren
steppes exposed to the approaching severities of the Russian winter.
Now we have an Air Force which is at last at least equal in size and
numbers, not to speak of quality, to the German Air Power.
Rather more than a year ago I announced to Parliament that we
were sending a battie fleet back into the Mediterranean. The
destruction of the German and Italian convoys - and the Admiralty
brings today the news of the destruction of another Italian destroyer
- the passage of our own supplies in many directions through that
sea, the broken morale of the Italian navy, all these show that we are
still the masters there.
Today I am able to go further. Owing to the effective help we are
getting in the Atlantic from the United States, owing to the sinking of
the Bismarck, owing to the completion of our splendid new
battleships and aircraft carriers of the largest size, as well as to the
cowing of the Italian navy already mentioned, I am able to go further
and announce to you here at the Lord Mayor's annual celebration
that we now feel ourselves strong enough to provide a powerful
naval force of heavy ships, with its necessary ancillary vessels, for
service if needed in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Thus we stretch
out the long arm of brotherhood and motherhood to the Australian
and New Zealand peoples and to the peoples of India, whose armies
and troops have already been fighting with so much distinction in the
Mediterranean theatre. And this movement of our naval forces, in
conjunction with the United States Main Fleet, may give a practical
proof to all who have eyes to see that the forces of freedom and
democracy have not by any means reached the limits of their power.
I must admit that, having voted for the Japanese alliance nearly 40
years ago, in 1902, and having always done my very best to promote
good relations with the Island Empire of Japan, and always having been a sentimental well-wisher to the japanese and an admirer of
their many gifts and qualities, I should view with keen sorrow the
opening of a conflict between japan and the English-speaking world.
The United States' time-honoured interests in the Far East are well
known. They are doing their utmost to find ways of preserving peace
in the Pacific. We do not know whether their efforts will be
successful, but should they fail I take this occasion to say, and it is
my duty to say, that, should the United States become involved in
war with japan, the British declaration will follow within the hour.
Viewing the vast sombre scene as dispassionately as possible, it
would seem a very hazardous adventure for the japanese people to
plunge quite needlessly into a world struggle in which they may well
find themselves opposed in the Pacific by States whose populations
comprise nearly three-quarters of the human race. If steel is the basic
foundation of modern war, it would be rather dangerous for a power
like japan, whose steel production is only about 7 million tons a
year, to provoke quite gratuitously a struggle with the United States,
whose steel production is now about 90 millions; and this would
take no account of the powerful contribution which the British
Empire can make. I hope therefore that the peace of the Pacific will
be preserved in accordance with the known wishes of japan's wisest
statesmen. But every preparation to defend British interests in the Far
East, and to defend the common cause now at stake, has been and is
being made.
Meanwhile how can we watch without emotion the wonderful
defence of their native soil and of their freedom and independence
which has been maintained single-handed, all alone, for five long
years by the Chinese people under the leadership of that great Asiatic
hero and Commander, General Chiang Kai-shek? It would be a
disaster of first magnitude to world civilisation if the noble resistance
to invasion and exploitation which has been made by the whole
Chinese race were not to result in the liberation of their hearths and
homes. That, I feel is a sentiment which is deep in all our hearts.
To return for a moment before I sit down to the contrast between
our position now and a year ago, I must remind you, I do not need to
remind you here in the City, that this time last year we did not know
where to turn for a dollar across the American exchange. By very
severe measures we had been able to gather and spend in America
about £500,000,000 sterling, but the end of our financial resources
was in sight - nay, had actually been reached. All we could do at that
time a year ago was to place orders in the United States without being able to see our way through, but on a tide of hope and not
without important encouragement.
Then came the majestic policy of the President and Congress of the
United States in passing the Lend and Lease Bill, under which in two
successive enactments about £3,000,000,000 sterling were dedicated
to the cause of world freedom without - mark this, for it is uniquethe setting up of any account in money. Never again let us hear the
taunt that money is the ruling thought or power in the hearts of the
American democracy. The Lend and Lease Bill must be regarded
without question as the most unsordid act in the whole of recorded
history.
We for our part have not been found unworthy of the increasing
aid we are receiving. We have made unparalleled financial and
economic sacrifices ourselves, and now that the Government and
people of the United States have declared their resolve that the aid
they are giving shall reach the fighting lines, we shall be able to strike
with all our might and main.
Thus we may, without exposing ourselves to any charge of
complacency, without in the slightest degree relaxing the intensity of
our war effort, give thanks to Almighty God for the many wonders
which have been wrought in so brief a space of time, and we may
derive fresh confidence from all that has happened and bend
ourselves to our task \-'lith all the force that is in our souls and with
every drop of blood that is in our bodies.
We are told from many quarters that we must soon expect what is
called a 'peace offensive' from Berlin. All the usual signs and
symptoms are already manifest, as the Foreign Secretary will confirm,
in neutral countries, and all these signs point in one di;ection. They
all show that the guilty men who have let Hell loose upon the world
are hoping to escape, with their fleeting triumphs and ill-gotten
plunders, from the closing net of doom.
We owe it to ourselves, we owe it to our Russian Ally, and to the
Government and people of the United States, to make it absolutely
clear that whether we are supported or alone, however long and hard
the toil may be, the British nation and His Majesty's Government in
intimate concert with the Governments of the great Dominions will
never enter into any negotiations with Hitler or any party in
Germany which represents the Nazi regime. In that resolve, we are
sure that the ancient City of London will be with us to the hilt and to
the end. "
"War with Japan, 8 December 1941, House of Commons",,"As soon as I heard, last night, that Japan had attacked the United States, I felt it necessary that Parliament should be immediately summoned. It is indispensable to our system of government that Parliament should play its full part in all the important acts of State and at all the crucial moments of the war; and I am glad to see that so many Members have been able to be in their places, despite thedispatched to the Japanese Charge d'Affaires at 1 o'clock today to
this effect:
Foreign Office, December 8th
Sir,
On the evening of Decembei 7th His Majesty's Goverment in the
United Kingdom learned that Japanese forces, without previous
warning, either in the form of a declaration of war or of an ultimatum
with a conditional declaration of war, had attempted a landing on the
coast of Malaya and bombed Singapore and Hong Kong.
In view of these wanton acts of unprovoked aggression, committed
in flagrant violation of International Law, and particularly of Article I
of the Third Hague Convention, relative to the opening of hostilities,
to which both Japan and the United Kingdom are parties, His
Majesty's Ambassador at Tokyo has been instructed to inform the
Imperial Japanese Government, in the name of His Majesty's
Government in the United Kingdom, that a state of war exists
between the two countries.
I have the honour to be, with high consideration,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,
Winston S. Churchill ...
The Japanese onslaught brought upon the United States and Great
Britain very serious injuries to our naval power. In my whole
experience I do not remember any naval blow so heavy or so painful
as the sinking of the Prince of Wales and the Repulse on Monday
last. These two vast, powerful ships constituted an essential feature in
our plans for meeting the new Japanese danger as it loomed against
us in the last few months. These ships had reached the right point at
the right moment, and were in every respect suited to the task
assigned to them. In moving to attack the Japanese transports and
landing-craft which were disembarking the invaders of Siam and
Malaya at the Kra Isthmus or thereabouts, Admiral Phillips was
undertaking a thoroughly sound, well-considered offensive operation, not indeed free from risk, but not different in principle from
many similar operations we have repeatedly carried out in the North
Sea and in the Mediterranean. Both ships were sunk in repeated air
attacks by bombers and by torpedo-aircraft. These attacks were
delivered with skill and determination. There were two high-level
attacks, both of which scored hits, and three waves of torpedo shortness of the notice. With the full approval of the nation, and of the aircraft of nine in each wave which struck each of our ships with
several torpedoes. There is no reason to suppose that any new
weapons or explosives were employed, or any bombs or torpedoes of
exceptional size. The continued waves of attack achieved their
purpose, and both ships capsized and sank, having destroyed seven
of the attacking aircraft.
The escorting destroyers came immediately to the rescue, and have
now arrived at Singapore crowded with survivors. Empire, I pledged the word of Great Britain, about a month ago, that should the United States be involved in war with Japan, a British declaration of war would follow wirhin the hour. I therefore spoke to President Roosevelt on the Atlantic telephone last night, with a view to arranging the timing of our respective declarations. The' President told me that he ·would this morning send a Message to Congress, which, of course, as is well known, can alone make a declaration of war on behalf of the United States, and I then assured him that we would follow immediately. However, it soon appeared that British territory in Malaya had also been the object of Japanese attack, and later on it was announced from Tokyo that the Japanese High Command - a curious form; not the Imperial Japanese Government - had declared that a state of war existed with Great Britain and the United States. That being so, there was no need to wait for the declaration by Congress. American time is very nearly six hours behind ours. The Cabinet, therefore, which met at 12.30 today, authorised an immediate declaration of war upon Japan. Instructions were sent to His Majesty's Ambassador at Tokyo, and a communication was"
"Joint Session of Congress, 26 December 1941, Washington, DC",,"I feel greatly honoured that you should have invited me to enter the United States Senate Chamber and address the representatives of both branches of Congress. The fact that my American forebears have for so many generations played their part in the life of the United States, and that here I am, an Englishman, welcomed in your midst, makes this experience one of the most moving and thrilling in my life, which is already long and has not been entirely uneventful. I wish indeed that my mother, whose memory I cherish across the vale of years, could have been here to see. By the way, I cannot help reflecting that if my father had been American and my mother British, instead of the other way round, I might have got here on my own. In that case, this would not have been the first time you would have heard my voice. In that case I should not have needed any invitation, but if I had, it is hardly likely it would have been
unanimous. So perhaps things are better as they are. I may confess,
however, that I do not feel quite like a fish out of water in a
legislative assembly where English is spoken.
I am a child of the House of Commons. I was brought up in my
father's house to believe in democracy. 'Trust the people' - that was
his message. I used to see him cheered at meetings and in the streets
by crowds of working men way back in those aristocratic Victorian
days when, as Disraeli said, the world was for the few, and for the
very few. Therefore I have been in full harmony all my life with the
tides which have flowed on both sides of the Atlantic against
privilege and monopoly, and I have steered confidently towards the
Gettysburg ideal of 'government of the people by the people for the
people.' lowe my advancement entirely to the House of Commons,
whose servant I am. In my country, as in yours, public men are proud
to be the servants of the State and would be ashamed to be its
masters. On any day, if (hey thought the people wanted it, the House
of Commons could by a simple vote remove me from my office. But I
am not worrying about it at all. As a matter of fact, I am sure they
will approve very highly of my journey here, for which I obtained the
King's permission, in order to meet the President of the United States
and to arrange with him all that mapping-out of our military plans,
and for all those intimate meetings of the high officers of the armed
services of both countries, which are indispensable to the successful
prosecution of the war.
I should like to say first of all how much I have been impressed and
encouraged by the breadth of view and sense of proportion which I
have found in all quarters over here to which I have had access.
Anyone who did not understand the size and solidarity of the
foundations of the United States might easily have expected to find
an excited, disturbed, self-centred atmosphere, with all minds fixed
upon the novel, startling, and painful episodes of sudden war as they
hit America. After all, the United States have been attacked and set
upon by three most powerfully-armed dictator States. The greatest
military power in Europe, the greatest military power in Asia,
Germany and Japan, Italy, too, have all declared, and are making,
war upon you, and a quarrel is opened, which can only end in their
overthrow or yours. But here in Washington, in these memorable
days, I have found an Olympian fortitude which, far from being
based upon complacency, is only the mask of an inflexible purpose
and the proof of a sure and well-grounded confidence in the final
outcome. We in Britain had the same feeling in our darkest days. We, too, were sure in the end all would be well. You do not, I am certain,
underrate the severity of the ordeal to which you and we have still to
be subjected. The forces ranged against us are enormous. They are
bitter, they are ruthless. The wicked men and their factions who have
launched their peoples on the path of war and conquest know that
they will be called to terrible account if they cannot beat down by
force of arms the peoples they have assailed. They will stop at
nothing. They have a vast accumulation of war weapons of all kinds.
They have highly-trained, disciplined armies, navies, and air services.
They have plans and designs which have long been tried and
matured. They will stop at nothing that violence or treachery can
suggest.
It is quite true that, on our side, our resources in manpower and
materials are far greater than theirs. But only a portion of your
resources is as yet mobilised and developed, and we both of us have
much to learn in the cruel art of war. We have therefore, without
doubt, a time of tribulation before us. In this time some ground will
be lost which it will be hanl and C()stiy to regain. Many disappointments and unpleasant surprises await us. Many of them will afflict us
before the full marshalling of our latent and total power can be
accomplished. For the best part of twenty years the youth of Britain
and America have been taught that war is evil, which is true, and that
it would never come again, which has been proved false. For the best
part of twenty years the youth of Germany, Japan and Italy have
been taught that aggressive war is the noblest duty of the citizen, and
that it should be begun as soon as the necessary weapons and
organisation had been made. We have performed the duties and
tasks of peace. They have plotted and planned for war. This,
naturally, has placed us in Britain and now places you in the United
States at a disadvantage which only time, courage, and strenuous,
untiring exertions can correct.
We have indeed to be thankful that so much time has been granted
to us. If Germany had tried to invade the British Isles after the French
collapse in June, 1940, and if Japan had declared war on the British
Empire and the United States at about the same date, no one could
say what disasters and agonies might not have been our lot. But now,
at the end of December, 1941, our transformation from easy-going
peace to total war efficiency has made very great progress. The broad
flow of munitions in Great Britain has already begun. Immense
strides have been made in the conversion of American industry to
military purposes, and now that the United States are at war it is
possible for orders to be given every day which a year or eighteen months hence will produce results in war power beyond anything
that has yet been seen or foreseen in the dictator States. Provided that
every effort is made, that nothing is kept back, that the whole manpower, brain-power, virility, valour, and civic virtue of the Englishspeaking world with all its galaxy of loyal, friendly, associated
communities and States - provided all that is bent unremittingly to
the simple and supreme task, I think it would be reasonable to hope
that the end of 1942 will see us quite definitely in a better position
than we are now, and that the year 1943 will enable us to assume the
initiative upon an ample scale.
Some people may be startled or momentarily depressed when, like
your President, I speak of a long and hard war. But our peoples
would rather know the truth, sombre though it be. And after all,
when we are doing the noblest work in the world, not only defending
our hearths and homes but the cause of freedom in other lands, the
question of whether deliverance comes in 1942, 1943, or 1944 falls
into its proper place in the grand proportions of human history. Sure
I am that this day - now - we are the masters of our fate; that the
task which has been set us is not above our strength; that its pangs
and toils are not beyond our endurance. As long as we have faith in
our cause and an unconquerable willpower, salvation will not be
denied us. In the words of the Psalmist, 'He shall not be afraid of evil
tidings; his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.' Not all the tidings will
be evil.
On the contrary, mighty strokes of war have already been dealt
against the enemy; the glorious defence of their native soil by the
Russian armies and people have inflicted wounds upon the Nazi
tyranny and system which have bitten deep, and will fester and
inflame not only in the Nazi body but in the Nazi mind. The boastful
Mussolini has crumbled already. He is now but a lackey and serf, the
merest utensil of his master's will. He has inflicted great suffering and
w.r.ong upon his own industrious people. He has been stripped of his
African empire, Abyssinia has been liberated. Our armies in the East,
which were so weak and ill-equipped at the moment of French
desertion, now control all the regions from Teheran to Benghazi, and
from Aleppo and Cyprus to the sources of the Nile.
For many months we devoted ourselves to preparing to take the
offensive in Libya. The very considerable battle, which has been
proceeding for the last six weeks in the desert, has been most fiercely
fought on both sides. Owing to the difficulties of supply on the desert
flanks, we were never able to bring numerically equal forces to bear
upon the enemy. Therefore we had to rely upon a superiority in the numbers and quality of tanks and aircraft, British and American.
Aided by these, for the first time, we have fought the enemy with
equal weapC)lls. For the first time we have made the Hun feel the
sharp edge of those tools V'!ith which he has enslaved Europe. The
armed forces of the enemy in Cyrenaica amounted to about 150,000,
of whom about one-third were Germans. General Auchinleck set out
to destroy totally that armed force. I have every reason to believe that
his aim will be fully accomplished. I am glad to be able to place
before you, members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, at this moment when you are entering the war, proof that with
proper weapons and proper organisation we are able to beat the life
out of the savage Nazi. What Hitler is suffering in Libya is only a
sample and foretaste of what we must give him and his accomplices,
wherever this war shall lead us, in every quarter of the globe.
There are good tidings also from blue water. The lifeline of
supplies which joins our two nations across the ocean, without which
all might fail, is flowing steadily and freely in spite of all the enemy
can do. It is a fact that the British Empire, which many thought
eighteen months ago was broken and ruined, is now incomparably
stronger, and is~growing stronger with every month. Lastly, if you
will forgive me for saying it, to me the best tidings of all is that the
United States, united as never before, have drawn the sword for
freedom and cast away the scabbard.
All these tremendous facts have led the subjugated peoples of
Europe to lift up their heads again in hope. They have put aside for
ever the shameful temptation of resigning themselves to the conqueror's will. Hope has returned to the hearts of scores of millions of men
and women, and with that hope there burns the flame of anger
against the brutal, corrupt invader, and still more fiercely burn the
fires of hatred and contempt for the squalid quislings whom he has
suborned. In a dozen famous ancient States now prostrate under the
Nazi yoke, the masses of the people of all classes and creeds await the
hour of liberation, when they too will be able once again to play their
part and strike their blows like men. That hour will strike, and its
solemn peal will proclaim that the night is past and that the dawn
has come.
The onslaught upon us so long and so secretly planned by Japan
has presented both our countries with grievous problems for which
we could not be fully prepared. If people ask me - as they have a
right to ask me in Engla!1d - why is it that you have not got ample
equipment of modern aircraft and Army weapons of all kinds in
Malaya and in the East Indies, I can only point to the victories General Auchinleck has gained in the Libyan campaign. Had we
diverted and dispersed our gradually growing resources between
Libya and Malaya, we should have been found wanting in both
theatres. If the United States have been found at a disadvantage at
various points in the Pacific Ocean, we know well that it is to no
small extent because of the aid you have been giving us in munitions
for the defence of the British Isles and for the Libyan campaign, and,
above all, because of your help in the battle of the Atlantic, upon
which all depends, and which has in consequence been successfully
and prosperously maintained. Of course it would have been much
better, I freely admit, if we had had enough resources of all kinds to
be at full strength at all threatened points; but considering how
slowly and reluctantly we brought ourselves to large-scale preparations, and how long such preparations take, we had no right to
expect to be in such a fortunate position.
The choice of how to dispose of our hitherto limited resources had
to be made by Britain in time of war and by the United States in time
of peace; and I believ~ that history will pronounce that upon the
whole - and it is upon the whole that these matters m\lst be judged -
the choice made was right. Now that we are together, now that we
are linked in a righteous comradeship of arms, now that our two
considerable nations, each in perfect unity, have joined all their life
energies in a common resolve, a new scene opens upon which a
steady light will glow and brighten.
Many people have been astonished that japan should in a single
day have plunged into war against the United States and the British
Empire. We all wonder why, if this dark design, with all its laborious
and intricate preparations, had been so long filling their secret minds,
they did not choose our moment of weakness eighteen months ago.
Viewed quite dispassionately, in spite of the losses we have suffered
and the further punishment we shall have to take, it certainly appears
to be an irrational act. It is, of course, only prudent to assume that
they have made very careful calculations and think they see their way
through. Nevertheless, there may be another explanation. We know
that for many years past the policy of japan has been dominated by
secret societies of subalterns and junior officers of the Army and
Navy, who have enforced their will upon successive japanese
Cabinets and Parliaments by the assassination of any japanese
statesman who opposed, or who did not sufficiently further, their
aggressive policy. It may be that those societies, dazzled and dizzy
with their own schemes of aggression and the prospect of early
victories, have forced their country against its better judgment into war. They have certainly embarked upon a very considerable
undertaking. For after the outrages they have committed upon us at
Pearl Harbor, in the Pacific Islands, in the Philippines, in Malaya,
and in the Dutch East Indies, they must now know that the stakes for
which they have decided to play are mortal.
When we consider the resources of the United States and the
British Empire compared to those of Japan, when we remember those
of China, which has so long and valiantly withstood invasion and
when also we observe the Russian menace which hangs over Japan, it
becomes still more difficult to reconcile Japanese action with
prudence or even with sanity. What kind of a people do they think
we are? Is it possible they do not realise that we shall never cease to
persevere against them until they have been taught a lesson which
they and the world wIll never forget?
Members of the Senate and members of the House of Representatives, I turn for one moment more from the turmoil and convulsions
of the present to the broader basis of the future. Here we are together
facing a group of mighty foes who seek our ruin; here we are
together defending all that to free men is dear. Twice in a single
generation the catastrophe of world war has fallen upon us; twice in
our lifetime has the long arm of fate reached across the ocean to
bring the United States into the forefront of the battle. If we had kept
together after the last war, if we had taken common measures for
our safety, this renewal of the curse need never have fallen upon us.
Do we not owe it to ourselves, to our children, to mankind
tormented, to make sure that these catastrophes shall not engulf us
for the third time? It has been proved that pestilences may break out
in the Old World, which carry their destructive ravages into the New
World, from which, once they are afoot, the New World cannot by
any means escape. Duty and prudence alike command first that the
germ-centres of hatred and revenge should be constantly and
vigilantly surveyed and treated in good time, and, secondly, that an
adequate organisation should be set up to make sure that the
pestilence can be controlled at its earliest beginnings before it spreads
and rages throughout the entire earth.
Five or six years ago it would have been easy, without shedding a
drop of blood, for the United States and Great Britain to have
insisted on fulfilment of the disarmament clauses of the treaties which
Germany signed after the Great War; that also would have been the
opportunity for assuring to Germany those raw materials which we
declared in the Atlantic Charter should not be denied to any nation,
victor or vanquished. That chance has passed. It is gone. Prodigious hammer-strokes have been needed to bring us together again, or if
you will allow me to use other language, I will say that he must
indeed have a blind soul who cannot see that some great purpose and
design is being worked out here below, of which we have the honour
to be the faithful servants. It is not given to us to peer into the
mysteries of the future. Still, I avow my hope and faith, sure and
inviolate, that in the days to come the British and American peoples
will for their own safety and for the good of all walk together side by
side in majesty, in justice, and in peace. "
"'Some chicken! Some neck!', 30 December 1941, Parliament, Ottawa",,"I should like to point out to you that we have not at any time asked
for any mitigation in the fury or malice of the enemy. The peoples of
the British Empire may love peace. They do not seek the lands or
wealth of any country, but they are a tough and hardy lot. We have
not journeyed all this way across the centuries, across the oceans,
across the mountains, across the prairies, because we are made of
sugar candy.
Look at the Londoners, the Cockneys; look at what they have
stood up to. Grim and gay with their cry 'We can take it,' and their
wartime mood of 'What is good enough for anybody is good
enough for us.' We have not asked that the rules of the game should
be modified. We shall never descend to the German and Japanese
level, but if anybody likes to play rough we can play rough too.
Hitler and his Nazi gang have sown the wind; let them reap the
whirlwind. Neither the length of the struggle nor any form of severity
which it may assume shall make us weary or shall make us quit ....
Let us then look back. We plunged into this war all unprepared
because we had pledged our word to stand by the side of Poland,
which Hitler had feloniously invaded, and in spite of a gallant resistance had soon struck down. There followed those astonishing
seven months which were called on this side of the Atlantic the
'phoney' war. Suddenly the explosion of pent-up German strength
and preparation burst upon Norway, Denmark, Holland, and
Belgium. All these absolutely blameless neutrals, to most of whom
Germany up to the last moment was giving every kind of guarantee
and assurance, were overrun and trampled down. The hideous
massacre of Rotterdam, where 30,000 people perished, showed the
ferocious barbarism in which the German Air Force revels when, as
in Warsaw and later Belgrade, it is able to bomb practically
undefended cities.
On top of all this came the great French catastrophe. The French
Army collapsed, and the French nation was dashed into utter and, as
it has so far proved, irretrievable confusion. The French Government
had at their own suggestion solemnly bound themselves with us not
to make a separate peace. It was their duty and it was also their
interest to go to North Africa, where they would have been at the
head of the French Empire. In Africa, with our aid, they would have
had overwhelming sea power. They would have had the recognition
of the United States, and the use of all the gold they had lodged
beyond the seas. If they had done this Italy might have been driven
out of the war before the end of 1940, and France would have held
her place as a nation in the counsels of the Allies and at the
conference table of the victors. But their generals misled them. When
I warned them that Britain would fight on alone whatever they did,
their generals told their Prime Minister and his divided Cabinet, 'In
three weeks England will have her neck wrung like a chicken.' Some
chicken! Some neck!"
"'I demand a Vote of Confidence', 27 January 1942, House of Commons",,"From time to time in the life of any Government there come occasions which mmt be clarified. No one who has read the newspapers of the last few weeks about our affairs at home and abroad can doubt that such an occasion is at hand. Since my return to this country, I have come to the conclusion that I must ask to be sustained by a Vote of Confidence from the House of Commons. This is a thoroughly normal, constitutional, democratic procedure. A Debate on the war has been asked for. I have arranged it in the fullest and freest manner for three whole days. Any Member will be free to say anything he thinks fit about or against the Administration or against the composition or personalities of the Government, to his heart's content, subject only to the reservation which the House is always so careful to observe about military secrets. Could you have anything freer than that? Could you have any higher expression of democracy than that? Very few other countries have institutions strong enough to sustain such a thing while they are fighting for their lives. lowe it to the House to explain to them what has led me to ask for their exceptional support at this time. It has been suggested that we should have a three days' Debate of this kind in which the Government would no doubt be lustily belaboured by some of those who have lighter burdens to carry, and that at the end we should separate without a Division. In this case sections of the Press which are hostile - and there are some whose hostility is pronounced - could declare that the Government's credit was broken, and it might even be hinted, after all that has passed and all the discussion there has been, that it had been privately intimated to me that I should be very reckless if I asked for a Vote of Confidence from Parliament. And the matter does not stop there. It must be remembered that these reports can then be flashed all over the world, and that they are repeated in enemy broadcasts night after night in order to show that the Prime Minister has no right to speak for the nation and that the Government in Britain is about to collapse. Anyone who listens to the fulminations which come from across the water knows that that is no exaggeration. Of course, these statements from foreign sources would not be true, but neither would it be helpful to anyone that
there should be any doubt about our position.
There is another aspect. We in this Island for a long time were
alone, holding aloft the torch. We are no longer alone now. We are
now at the centre and among those at the summit of 26 United
Nations, comprising more than three-quarters of the population of
the globe. Whoever speaks for Britain at this moment must be known
to speak, not only in the name of the people - and that I feel pretty
sure I may - but in the name of Parliament and, above all, of the
House of Commons. It is a genuine public interest that requires that
these facts should be made manifest afresh in a formal way.
We have had a great deal of bad news lately from the Far East, and
I think it highly probable, for reasons which I shall presently explain,
that we shall have a great deal more. Wrapped up in this bad news
will be many tales of blunders and shortcomings, both in foresight
and action. No one will pretend for a moment that disasters like
these occur without there having been faults and shortcomings. I see
all this rolling towards us like the waves in a storm, and that is
another reason why I require a formal, solemn Vote of Confidence
from the House of Commons, which hitherto in this struggle has
never flinched. The House would fail in its duty if it did not insist
upon two things, first, freedom of debate, and, secondly, a clear,
honest, blunt vote thereafter. Then we shall all know where we are,
and all those with whom we have to deal, at home and abroad,
friend or foe, will know where we are and where they are. It is
because we are to have a free debate, in which perhaps 20 to 30
Members can take part, that I demand an expression of opinion from
the 300 or '400 Members who will have to sit silent.
It is because things have gone badly and worse is to come that I
demand a Vote of Confidence. This will be placed on the Paper
today, to be moved at a later stage. I do not see why this should
hamper anyone. If a Member has helpful criticisms to make, or even
severe corrections to administer, that may be perfectly consistent
with thinking that in respect of the Administration, such as it is, he
might go farther and fare worse. But if an hon. Gentleman dislikes
the Government very much and feels it in the public interest that it
should be broken up, he ought to have the manhood to testify his
convictions in the Lobby. There is no need to be mealy-mouthed in
debate. There is no objection to anything being said, plain, or even
plainer, and the Government will do their utmost to conform to any
standard which may be set in the course of the debate. But no one
need be mealy-mouthed in debate, and no one should be chicken-hearted in voting. I have voted against Governments I have been
elected to support, and, looking back, I have sometimes felt very glad
that I did so. Everyone in these rough times must do what he thinks is
his duty.
The House of Commons, which is at present the most powerful
representative Assembly in the world, must also - I am sure, will also
- bear in mind the effect produced abroad by all its proceedings. We
have also to remember how oddly foreigners view our country and
its way of doing things. When Rudolf Hess flew over here some
months ago he firmly believed that he had only to gain access to
certain circles in this country for what he described as 'the Churchill
clique' to be thrown out of power and for the Government to be set
up with which Hitler could negotiate a magnanimous peace. The
only importance attaching to the opinions of Hess is the fact that he
was fresh from the atmosphere of Hitler's intimate table. But, I can
assure you that since I have been back in this country I have had
anxious inquiries from a dozen countries, and reports of enemy
propaganda in a score of countries, all turning upon the point
whether His Majesty's present Government is to be dismissed from
power or not. This may seem silly to us, but in those mouths abroad
it is hurtful and mischievous to the common effort. I am not asking
for any special, personal favours in these circumstances, but I am
sure the House would wish to make its position clear; therefore I
stand by the ancient, constitutional, Parliamentary doctrine of free
debate and faithful voting ....
There never has been a moment, there never could have been a
moment, when Great Britain or the British Empire, single-handed,
could fight Germany and Italy, could wage the Battle of Britain, the
Battle of the Atlantic and the Battle of the Middle East - and at the
same time stand thoroughly prepared in Burma, the Malay Peninsula, and generally in the Far East against the impact of a vast
military Empire like Japan, with more than 70 mobile divisions, the
third navy in the world, a great air force, and the thrust of 80 or 90
millions of hardy, warlike Asiatics. If we had started to scatter our
forces over these immense areas in the Far East, we should have been
ruined. If we had moved large armies of troops urgently needed on
the war fronts to regions which were not at war and might never be
at war, we should have been altogether wrong. We should have cast
away the chance, which has now become something more than a
chance, of all of us emerging safely from the terrible plight in which
we have been plunged ....
The outstanding question upon which the House should form its judgment for the purposes of the impending Division is whether His
Majesty's Government were right in giving a marked priority in the
distribution of the forces and equipment we could send overseas, to
Russia, to Libya, and, <;:0 a lesser extent, to the Levant-Caspian
danger front, and whether we were right in accepting, for the time
being, a far lower standard of forces and equipment for the Far East
than for these other theatres ....
Let me, in conclusion, return to the terrific changes which have
occurred in our affairs during the last few months and particularly in
the last few weeks. We have to consider the prospects of the war in
1942 and also in 1943, and, as I said just now, it is not useful to look
farther ahead than that. The moment that the United States was set
upon and attacked by Japan, Germany and Italy - that is to say,
within a few days of December 7, 1941 - I was sure it was my duty
to cross the Atlantic and establish the closest possible relationship
with the President and Government of the United States, and also to
develop the closest contacts, personal and professional, between the
British Chiefs of Staff and their transatlantic deputies, and with the
American Chiefs of Staff who were there to meet them.
Having crossed the Atlantic, it was plainly my duty to visit the
great Dominion of Canada. The House will have read with
admiration and deep interest the speech made by the Prime Minister
of Canada yesterday on Canada's great and growing contribution to
the common cause in men, in money, and in materials. A notable
part of that contribution is the financial offer which the Canadian
Government have made to this country. The sum involved is one
billion Canadian dollars, about £225,000,000. I know the House
will wish me to convey to the Government of Canada our lively
appreciation of their timely and most generous offer. It is unequalled
in its scale in the whole history of the British Empire, and it is a
convincing proof of the determination of Canada to make her
maximum contribution towards the successful prosecution of the
war.
During those three weeks which I spent in Mr Roosevelt's home
and family, I established with him relations not only of comradeship,
but, I think I may say, of friendship. We can say anything to each
other, however painful. When we parted he wrung my hand, saying,
'We will fight this through to the bitter end, whatever the cost may
be.' Behind him rises the gigantic and hitherto unmobilised power of
the people of the United States, carrying with them in their life and
death struggle the entire, or almost the entire, Western hemisphere .... Although I feel the broadening swell of victory and liberation
bearing us and all the tortured peoples onwards safely to the final
goal, I must confess to feeling the weight of the war upon me even
more than in the tremendous summer days of 1940. There are so
many fronts which are open, so many vulnerable points to defend, so
many inevitable misfortunes, so many shrill voices raised to take
advantage, now that we can breathe more freely, of all the turns and
twists of war. Therefore, I feel entitled to come to the House of
Commons, whose servant I am, and ask them not to press me to act
against my conscience and better judgment and make scapegoats in
order to improve my own position, not to press me to do the things
which may be clamoured for at the moment but which will not help
in our war effort, but, on the contrary, to give me their encouragement and to give me their aid. I have never ventured to predict the
future. I stand by my original programme, blood, toil, tears and
sweat, which is all I have ever offered, to which I added, five months
later, 'many shortcomings, mistakes and disappointments'. But it is
because I see the light gleaming behind the clouds and broadening on
our path, that I make so bold now as to demand a declaration of
confidence of the House of Commons as an additional weapon in the
armoury of the United Nations. "
"'Singapore has fallen', 15 February 1942, Broadcast, London",,"Tonight I speak to you at home; I speak to you in Australia and New Zealand, for whose safety we will strain every nerve; to our loyal friends in India and Burma; to our gallant Allies, the Dutch and Chinese; and to our kith and kin in the United States. I speak to you all under the shadow of a heavy and far-reaching military defeat. It is a British and Imperial defeat. Singapore has fallen. All the Malay Peninsula has been overrun. Other dangers gather about us out there, and none of the dangers which we have hitherto successfully
withstood at home and in the East are in any way diminished. This,
therefore, is one of those moments when the British race and nation
can show their quality and their genius. This is one of those moments
when it can draw from the heart of misfortune the vital impulses of
victory. Here is the moment to display that calm and poise combined
with grim determination which not so long ago brought us out of the
very jaws of death. Here is another occasion to show - as so often in
our long story - that we can meet reverses with dignity and with
renewed accessions of strength. We must remember that we are no
longer alone. We are in the midst of a great company. Three-quarters
of the human race are now moving with us. The whole future of
mankind may depend upon our action and upon our conduct. So far
we have not failed. We shall not fail now. Let us move forward
steadfastly together into the storm and through the storm."
"Prime Minister for two years, 10 May 1942, Broadcast, London",,"I have now served for two years exactly to a day as the King's First Minister. Therefore I thought it would be a good thing if I had a talk to you on the broadcast, to look back a little on what we have come through, to consider how we stand now, and to peer cautiously, but at the same time resolutely, into the future. The tremendous period through which we have passed has certainly been full of anxieties and exertions; it has been marked by many misfortunes and disappointments. This time two years ago the Germans were beating down Holland and Belgium by unprovoked brutal, merciless invasion, and very soon there came upon us the total defeat of France and the fatal surrender at Bordeaux. Mussolini, the Italian miscalculator, thought he saw his chance of a cheap and easy triumph, and rich plunder for no fighting. He struck at the back f a dying France, and at what he believed was a doomed Britain. We
were left alone - our quarter of a million Dunkirk troops saved, only
disarmed; ourselves, as yet unarmed - to face the might of victorious
Germany, to face also the carefully saved-up strength of an Italy
which then still ranked as a first-class Power.
Here at home in this island, invasion was near; the Mediterranean
was closed to us; the long route round the Cape, where General
Smuts stands on guard, alone was open; our small, ill-equipped
forces in Egypt and the Sudan seemed to await destruction. All the
world, even our best friends, thought that our end had come.
Accordingly, we prepared ourselves to conquer or to perish. We were
united in that solemn, majestic hour; we were all equally resolved at
least to go down fighting. We cast calculation to the winds; no
wavering voice was heard; we hurled defiance at our foes; we faced
our duty, and, by the mercy of God, we were preserved.
It fell to me in those days to express the sentiments and resolves of
the British nation in that supreme crisis of its life. That was to me an
honour far beyond any dreams or ambitions I had ever nursed, and it
is one that cannot be taken away. For a whole year after the fall of
France we stood alone, keeping the flag of freedom flying, and the
hopes of the world alive. We conquered the Italian Empire, we
destroyed or captured almost all Mussolini's African army; we
liberated Abyssinia; we have so far successfully protected Palestine,
Syria, Persia and Iraq from German designs. We have suffered
grievous reverses in going to the aid of the heroic Greeks; we bore
unflinching many a heavy blow abroad, and still more in our cities
here at home; and all this time, cheered and helped by President
Roosevelt and the United States, we stood alone, neither faltering nor
flagging.
Where are we now? Can anyone doubt that if we are worthy of it,
as we shall be, we have in our hands our own future? As in the last
war, so in this, we are moving through many reverses and defeats to
complete and final victory. We have only to endure and to persevere,
to conquer. Now we are no longer unarmed; we are well armed.
Now we are not alone; we have mighty allies, bound irrevocably by
solemn faith and common interests to stand with us in the ranks of
the United Nations. There can only be one end. When it will come,
or how it will come, I cannot tell. But, when we survey the
overwhelming resources which are at our disposal, once they are
fully marshalled and developed - as they can be, as they will be - we
may stride forward into the unknown with growing confidence During the time that we were all alone, we were steadily growing
stronger. He would have been a bold man, however, who in those
days would have put down in black and white exactly how we were
going to win. But, as has happened before in our island history, by
remaining steadfast and unyielding - stubborn, if you will- against a
Continental tyrant, we reacbed the moment when that tyrant made a
fatal blunder. Dictators, as well as democracies and parliamentary
governments, make mistakes sometimes. Indeed, when the whole
story is told, I believe it will be found that the Dictators, for all their
preparations and prolonged scheming, have made greater mistakes
than the Democracies they have assailed. Even Hitler makes mistakes
sometimes. In June last, without the slightest provocation, and in
breach of a pact of non-aggression, he invaded the lands of the
Russian people. At that time he had the strongest army in the world,
trained in war, flushed with incredible unbroken success, and
equipped with limitless munitions and the most modern weapons. He
had also secured for himself the advantages of surprise and treachery.
Thus he drove the youth and manhood of the German nation
forward into Russia.
The Russians, under their warrior chief, Stalin, sustained losses
which no other country or government has ever borne in so short a
time and lived. But they, like us, were resolved never to give in. They
poured out their own blood upon their native soil. They kept their
faces to the foe. From the very first day to the end of the year, and on
till tonight, they fought '.vith unflinching valour. And, from the very
first day when they were attacked, when no one could tell how things
would go, we made a brotherhood with them, and a solemn compact
to destroy Nazidom and all its works. Then Hitler made his second
grand blunder. He forgot about the winter. There is a winter, you
know, in Russia. For a good many months the temperature is apt to
fall very low. There is snow, there is frost, and all that. Hitler forgot
about this Russian winter. He must have been very loosely educated.
We all heard about it at school; but he forgot it. I have never made
such a bad mistake as that. So winter came, and fell upon his ill-clad
armies, and with the winter came the valiant Russian counterattacks. No one can say with certainty how many millions of
Germans have already perished in Russia and its snows. Certainly
more have perished than were killed in the whole four and a quarter
years of the last war. That is probably an understatement. So
besotted is this man in his lust for blood and conquest, so blasting is
the power he wields over the lives of Germans, that he even blurted out the other day that his armies would be better clothed and his
locomotives better prepared for their second winter in Russia than
they were for their first.
There was an admission about the length of the war that struck a
chill into German hearts as cold as the icy winds of Russia. What will
be the sufferings of the German manhood in this new bloodbath?
What is there in front of Hitler now? Certain it is that the Russian
armies are stronger than they were last year, that they have learnt by
hard experience to fight the Germans in the field, that they are wellequipped, and that their constancy and courage are unquenched.
That is what is in front of Hitler. What is he leaving behind him? He
leaves behind him a Europe starving and in chains; a Europe in
which his execution squads are busy in a dozen countries every day; a
Europe which has learned to hate the Nazi name as no name has ever
been hated in the recorded history of mankind; a Europe burning for
revolt whenever the opportunity comes.
But this is not all he has left behind. We are on his tracks, and so is
the great Republic of the United States. Already the Royal Air Force
has set about it; the British, and presently the American, bombing
offensive against Germany will be one of the principal features in this
year's world war. Now is the time to use our increasingly superior air
strength, to strike hard and continually at the home front in
Germany, from which so much evil has leaked out upon the world,
and which is the foundation of the whole enormous German
invasion of Russia. Now, while the German armies will be bleeding
and burning up their strength against the two-thousand-mile Russian
line, and when the news of casualties by hundreds of thousands is
streaming back to the German Reich, now is the time to bring home
to the German people the wickedness of their rulers, by destroying
under their very eyes the factories and seaports on which their war
effort depends.
German propaganda has been constantly appealing of late to
British public opinion to put a stop to these severe forms of warfare,
which, according to the German view, should be the strict monopoly
of the Herrenvolk. Herr Hitler himself has not taken at all kindly to
this treatment, and he has been good enough to mingle terrible
threats with his whinings. He warns us, solemnly, that if we go on
smashing up the German cities, his war factories and his bases, he
will retaliate against our cathedrals and historic monuments - if they
are not too far inland. We have heard his threats before. Eighteen
months ago, in September, 1940, when he thought he had an overwhelming Air Force at his command, he declared that he would
rub out - that was the actual expression, rub out - our towns and
cities. And he certainly had a good try. Now the boot is on the other
leg. Herr Hitler has even called in question the humanity of these
grim developments of war. What a pity this conversation did not
take place in his heart before he bombed Warsaw, or massacred
twenty thousand Dutch folk in defenceless Rotterdam, or wreaked
his cruel vengeance upon the open city of Belgrade! In those days, he
used to boast that for every ton of bombs we dropped on Germany,
he would drop ten times, or even a hundred times as many on
Britain. Those were his words, and that was his belief. Indeed, for a
time we had to suffer very severely from his vastly superior strength
and utter ruthlessness.
But now it is the other way round. We are in a position to carry
into Germany many times the tonnage of high explosives which he
can send here, and this proportion will increase all the summer, all
the autumn, all the winter, all the spring, all the summer, and so on,
till the end! The accuracy of our bombing has nearly doubled, and,
with continued practice, I expect it will improve still more.
Moreover, at the same time, our methods of dealing with his raiders
over here have more than repaid the immense care and science
bestowed upon them, and the very large scale upon which they are
applied. During the month of April we have destroyed one-tenth of
all the raiding aircraft which have assailed our island; whereas,
acting on a scale several times as big, the losses which we have
suffered have been proportionately far smaller. We have waited long
for this turning of the tables, and have taken whatever came to us
meanwhile.
You will remember how the German propaganda films, seeking to
terrorise neutral countries and glorying in devastating violence, were
wont to show rows of great German bombers being loaded up with
bombs, then flying in the air in battle array, then casting down
showers of bombs upon the defenceless towns and villages below,
choking them in smoke and flame. All this was represented from the
beginning of the war to neutral countries as the German way of
making war. All this was intended to make the world believe that
resistance to the German will was impossible, and that subjugation
and slavery were the safest and easiest road. Those days are gone.
Though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceedingly
small. And for my part, I hail it as an example of sublime and poetic
justice that those who have loosed these horrors upon mankind will now in their homes and persons feel the shattering strokes of just
retribution.
We have a long list of German cities in which all the vital
industries of the German war machine are established. All these it
will be our stern duty to deal with, as we have already dealt with
Lubeck, and Rostock, and half-a-dozen important places. The civil
population of Germany have, however, an easy way to escape from
these severities. All they have to do is to leave the cities where
munitions work is being carried on - abandon their work, and go
into the fields, and watch their home fires burning from a distance. In
this way they may find time for meditation and repentance; there
they may remember the millions of Russian women and children they
have driven out to perish in the snows, and the mass executions of
peasantry and prisaners-of-war which in varying scales they are
inflicting upon so many of the ancient and famous peoples of Europe.
There they may remember that it is the villainous Hitlerite regime
which is responsible for dragging Germany through misery and
slaughter to ultimate ruin, and learn that the tyrant's overthrow is
the first step to world liberation.
We now wait in what is a stormy lull, but still a lull, before the
hurricane bursts again in full fury on the Russian front. We cannot
tell when it will begin: we have not so far seen any evidences of those
great concentrations of German masses which usually precede their
large-scale offensives. They may have been successfully concealed, or
may not yet have been launched eastward. But it is now the tenth of
May, and the days are passing. We send our salutations to the
Russian armies, and we hope that the thousands of tanks and
aeroplanes which have been carried to their aid from Britain and
America will be a useful contribution to their own magnificently
developed and reorganised munitions resources.
There is, however, one serious matter which I must mention to
you. The Soviet Government have expressed to us the view that the
Germans in the desperation of their assault may make use of poison
gas against the armies and people of Russia. We are ourselves firmly
resolved not to use this odious weapon unless it is used first by the
Germans. Knowing our Hun, however, we have not neglected to
make preparations on a formidable scale. I wish now to make it plain
that we shall treat rhe unprovoked use of poison gas against our
Russian ally exactly as if it were used against ourselves, and if we are
satisfied that this new outrage has been committed by Hitler, we shall
use our great and growing air superiority in the West to carry gas
warfare on the largest possible scale far and wide against military objectives in Germany. It is thus for Hitler to choose whether he
wishes to add this additional horror to aerial warfare. We have for
some time past been bringing our defensive and precautionary
arrangements up to date, and I now give public warning, so that
there may be no carelessness or neglect. Of one thing I am sure: that
the British people, who have entered into the full comradeship of war
with our Russian ally, will not shrink from any sacrifice or trial
which that comradeship may require.
Meanwhile, our deliveries of tanks, aircraft and munitions to
Russia from Britain and from the United States continue upon the
full scale. We have the duty of escorting the northern convoys to
their destination. Our sailors and merchant seamen face the fearful
storms of the Arctic Circle, the lurking U-boats and shore-based
aircraft, as well as attacks by German destroyers and surface craft,
with their customary steadfastness and faithful courage. So far,
though not without some loss both to the supply ships and their
escorts, every convoy has successfully fought its way through, and we
intend to persevere and fight it out on this northern route to the
utmost of our strength.
Is there anything else we can do to take the weight off Russia? We
are urged from many quarters to invade the Continent of Europe and
so form a second front. Naturally, I shall not disclose what our
intentions are, but there is one thing I will say: I welcome the
militant, aggressive spirit of the British nation so strongly shared
across the Atlantic Ocean. Is it not far better that in the thirty-second
month of this hard war we should find this general desire to come to
the closest grips with the enemy, than that there should be any signs
of war-weariness? Is it not far better that demonstrations of
thousands of people should gather in Trafalgar Square demanding
the most vehement and audacious attacks, than that there should be
the weepings and wailings and peace agitations which in other lands
and other wars have often hampered the action and vigour of
governments? It is encouraging and inspiring to feel the strong
heartbeats of a free nation, surging forward, stern and undaunted, in
a righteous cause. We must not fail them, either in daring or in
wisdom.
This week, two islands have been in our minds - one is very large,
the other very small - Madagascar and Malta. We have found it
necessary to take precautions to prevent Madagascar falling into
enemy hands, by some dishonourab1e and feeble drifting or connivance by Vichy, like that which injured us so much in Indo-China. It is
three months since the decision was taken, and more than two months since the expedition left these shores. Its first task was to
secure the splendid harbour of Diego Suarez, in the northern part of
Madagascar, which, if it had fallen into Japanese hands, might have
paralysed all our communications with India and the Middle East.
While the troops were on the sea, I must tell you I felt a shiver every
time I saw the word 'Madagascar' in the newspapers. All those
articles with diagrams and measured maps, showing how very
important it was for us to take Madagascar and forestall the
Japanese, and be there 'first for once', as they said, filled me with
apprehension. There was no question of leakage, or breach of
confidence. As they say, great minds think alike. But shrewd surmise
may be as dangerous as leakage. And it was with considerable relief
that I learned the difficulties of our soldiers and their losses had been
exaggerated, and that the operation had been swiftly and effectually
carried out.
We hold this island in trust; we hold it in trust for that gallant
France which we have known and marched with, and whose
restoration to her place among the great Powers of the world is
indispensable to the future of Europe. Madagascar rests under the
safeguard of the United Nations. Vichy, in the grip of the Germans,
has been made to bluster and protest. The France that rose at St
Nazaire, and will one day rise in indescribable fury against the Nazis,
understands what we have done and gives us its trust.
The smaller island is Malta, a tiny rock of history and romance.
Today we welcomed back to our shores General Dobbie, for nearly
two years the heroic defender of Malta. The burden which he has
borne so honourably and for so long entitles him to release and
repose. In Lord Gort we have a new impulse. His work at Gibraltar
has been of the highest order. It was not his fault that our armies did
not have their chance in France. He is a grand fighter. For the
moment the terrific air attack on Malta has slackened. It looks as if a
lot of enemy aircraft had moved eastward. I wonder why? If so,
another intense air battle for Malta, upon which the enemy have
concentrated such an immense preponderance of strength, and for
which they have sacrificed so many of those aircraft which they now
have to count more carefully every day - another intense air battle
will have been definitely won. But other perils remain, and I know of
no man in the British Empire to whom I would sooner entrust the
combating and beating-down of those perils than Lord Gort.
If we look back today over the course of the war as it has so far
unfolded, we can see that it seems to divide itself into four very
clearly defined chapters. The first ended with the overrunning by the Nazis of Western Europe and with the fall of France. The second
chapter, Britain alone, ended with Hitler's attack upon Russia. I will
call the third chapter which then began, 'the Russian glory'. May it
long continue! The fourth chapter opened at Pearl Harbor, when the
military party in Japan treacherously attacked the United States and
Great Britain in the Far East. That is where we are now.
The aggression of Italy in 1940 had carried the war from Europe to
Africa. The aggression of Japan has involved all Asia, including
unconquerable China, and in one way or another has drawn in, or will
draw in, the whole of the American Continent. Thus the struggle has
become world-wide, and the fate of all states and nations and their
future is at stake. This latest chapter - universal war - confronts us
with many difficulties and immense complications. But is there any
thoughtful sensible per::;on who cannot see how vastly and decisively
the awful balances have turned to the advantage of the cause of
freedom? It is true that the Japanese, taking advantage of our
preoccupations elsewhere, and of the fact that the United States had
striven for so long to keep the peace, have seized more easily and more
quickly than they expected their lands of booty and desire in the East
Indian Archipelago. Henceforward they will find resistance stiffening
on all their widely-spread fronts. They can ill afford losses such as
those they have sustained in the naval action of the Coral Sea; so far
we have no detailed accounts, but it is obvious, if only from the lies the
Japanese have felt compelled to tell about the sinking of a battleship of
the Warspite class, that a most vigorous and successful battle has been
fought by the United States and Australian naval forces.
The Japanese warlords cannot be indifferent to the losses of
aircraft inflicted upon them at so many points, and particularly off
the northern coasts of Australia, and in their repulse at Colombo and
Trincomalee. At the start the pent-up, saved-up resources of Japan
were bound to prevail in the Far Eastern theatre; but the strength of
the United States, expressed in units of modern war power, actual
and potential, is alone many times greater than the power of Japan.
And we also shall make our contribution to the final defeat and
punishment of this ambitious and greedy nation. Time will, however,
be needed before the true strengths on either side of the Eastern war
become manifest. I am not prone to make predictions, but I have no
doubt tonight that the British and American sea power will grip and
hold the Japanese, and that overwhelming air power, covering
vigorous military operations, will lay them low. This would come to
pass, of course, very much sooner, should anything happen to Hitler
in Europe. Therefore tonight I give you a message of good cheer. You deserve
it, and the facts endorse it. But be it good cheer or be it bad cheer will
make no difference to us; we shall drive on to the end, and do our
duty, win or die. God helping us, we can do no other. "
"Motion of Censure, 2 July 1942, House of Commons",,"This long Debate has now reached its final stage. What a remarkable example it has been of the unbridled freedom of our Parliamentary institutions in time of war! Everything that could be thought of or raked up has been used to weaken confidence in the Government, has been used to prove that Ministers are incompetent and to weaken their confidence in themselves, to make the Army distrust the backing it is getting from the civil power, to make the workmen lose confidence in the weapons they are striving so hard to make, to represent the Government as a set of nonentities over whom the Prime Minister towers, and then to undermine him in his own heart and, if possible, before the eyes of the nation. All this poured out by cable and radio to all parts of the world, to the distress of all our friends and to the delight of all our foes. I am in favour of this freedom, which no other country would use, or dare to use, in times of mortal peril such as those through which we are passing. But the story must not end there, and I make now my appeal to the House of Commons to make sure that it does not end there. Although I have done my best, my utmost, to prepare a full and
considered statement for the House, I must confess that I have found
it very difficult, even during the bitter animosity of the diatribe of the
hon. Member for Ebbw Vale [Mr Bevan], with all its carefully aimed
and calculated hostility, to concentrate my thoughts upon this
Debate and to withdraw them from the tremendous and most critical
battle now raging in Egypt ....
The mover of this Vote of Censure has proposed that I should be
stripped of my responsibilities for Defence in order that some
military figure or some other unnamed personage should assume the
general conduct of the war, that he should have complete control of
the Armed Forces of the Crown, that he should be the Chief of the
Chiefs of the Staff, that he should nominate or dismiss the generals or
the admirals, that he should always be ready to resign, that is to say,
to match himself against his political colleagues, if colleagues they
could be considered, if he did not get all he wanted, that he should
have under him a Royal Duke as Commander-in-Chief of the Army,
and finally, I presume, though this was not mentioned, that this
unnamed personage should find an appendage in the Prime Minister
to make the necessary explanations, excuses and apologies to
Parliament when things go wrong, as they often do and often will.
That is at any rate a policy. It is a system very different from the
Parliamentary system under which we live. It might easily amount to
or be converted into a dictatorship. I wish to make it perfectly clear
that as far as I am concerned I shall take no part in such a system.
Sir J. Wardlaw-Milne: I hope that my right hon. Friend has not
forgotten the original sentence, which was 'subject to the War
Cabinet'?
Mr Churchill: Subject to the War Cabinet, against which this allpowerful potentate is not to hesitate to resign on every occasion if he
could not get his way. It is a plan, but it is not a plan in which I
should personally be interested to take part, and I do not think that it
is one which would commend itself to this House. The setting down
of this Vote of Censure by Members of all parties is a considerable
event. Do not, I beg you, let the House underrate the gravity of what
has been done. It has been trumpeted all round the world to our
disparagement, and when every nation, friend and foe, is waiting to
see what is the true resolve and conviction of the House of
Commons, it must go forward to the end. All over the world,
throughout the United States, as I can testify, in Russia, far away in
China, and throughout every subjugated country, all our friends
are waiting to know whether there is a strong, solid Government in Britain and whether its national leadership is to be challenged or
not. Every vote counts. If those who have assailed us are reduced
to contemptible proportions and their Vote of Censure on the
National Government is converted to a vote of censure upon its
authors, make no mistake, a cheer will go up from every friend
of Britain and every faithful servant of our cause, and the knell
of disappointment will ring in the ears of the tyrants we are striving
to overthrow. "
"'The bright gleam of victory', 10 November 1942, Mansion House, London",,"I have never promised anything but blood, tears, toil, and sweat. Now, however, we have a new experience. We have victory - a remarkable and definite victory. The bright gleam has caught the helmets of our soldiers, and warmed and cheered all our hearts. The late M. Venizelos observed that in all her wars England - he should have said Britain, of course - always wins one battle - the last. It would where the disaster would be most far-reaching and irrecoverable.
All the various elements in our line of battle played their parts -
Indian troops, Fighting French, the Greeks, the representatives of
Czechoslovakia and the others who took part. The Americans
rendered powerful and invaluable service in the air. But as it
happened - as the course of the battle turned - it has been fought
throughout almost entirely by men of British blood from home and
from the Dominions on the one hand, and by Germans on the other.
The Italians were left to perish in the waterless desert or surrender as
they are doing.
The fight between the British and the Germans was intense and
fierce in the extreme. It was a deadly grapple. The Germans have
been outmatched and outfought with the very kind of weapons with
which they had beaten down so many small peoples, and also large
unprepared peoples. They have been beaten by the very technical
apparatus on which they counted to gain them the domination of the
world. Especially is this true of the air and of the tanks and of the
artillery, which has come back into its own on the battlefield. The
Germans have received back again that measure of fire and steel
which they have so often meted out to others.
Now this is not the end. It is not even the begining of the end. But
it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. Henceforth Hitler's Nazis will
meet equally well armed, and perhaps better-armed troops. Henceforth they will have to face in many theatres of war that superiority
in the air which they have so often used without mercy against
others, of which they buasted all round the world, and which they
intended to use as an instrument for convincing all other peoples that
all resistance to them was hopeless. When I read of the coastal road
crammed with fleeing German vehicles under the blasting attacks of
the Royal Air Force, I could not but remember those roads of France
and Flanders, crowded, not with fighting men, but with helpless
refugees - women and children - fleeing with their pitiful barrows
and household goods, upon whom such merciless havoc was
wreaked. I have, I trust, a humane disposition, but I must say I could
not help feeling that what was happening, however grievous, was
only justice grimly reclaiming her rights.
It will be my duty in the near future to give to Parliament a full and
particular account of these operations. All I will say of them at
present is that the victory which has already been gained gives good
prospect of becoming decisive and final so far as the defence of Egypt
is concerned.
But this Battle of Egypt, in itself so important, was designed and  seem to have begun rather earlier this time. General Alexander, with his bri""tliant comrade and lieutenant, General Montgomery, has gained a glorious and decisive victory in what I think should be called the Battle of Egypt. Rommel's army has been defeated. It has been routed. It has been very largely destroyed as a fighting force. This battle was not fought for the sake of gaining positions or so many square miles of desert territory. General Alexander and General Montgomery fought it with one single idea. They meant to destroy the armed force of the enemy, and to destroy it at the place timed as a prelude and counterpart of the momentous enterprise
undertaken by the United States at the western end of the
Mediterranean - an enterprise under United States command in
which our Army, Air Force, and, above all, our Navy, are bearing an
honourable and important share. Very full accounts have been
published of all that is happening in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunis.
The President of the United States, who is Commander-in-Chief of
the armed forces of America, is the author of this mighty undertaking, and in all of it I have been his active and ardent lieutenant ....
At this time our thoughts turn towards France, groaning in
bondage under the German heel. Many ask themselves the question:
Is France finished? Is that long and famous history, adorned by so
many manifestations of genius and valour, bearing with it so much
that is precious to culture and civilisation, and above all to the
liberties of mankind - is all that now to sink for ever into the ocean
of the past, or will France rise again and resume her rightful place in
the structure of what may one day be again the family of Europe? I
declare to you here, on this .::onsiderable occasion, even now when
misguided or suborned Frenchmen are firing upon their rescuers, I
declare to you my faith that France will rise again. While there are
men like General de Gaulle and all those who follow him - and they
are legion throughout France - and men like General Giraud, that
gallant warrior whom no prison can hold, while there are men like
those to stand forward in the name and in the cause of France, my
confidence in the future of France is sure.
For ourselves we han no wish but to see France free and strong,
with her Empire gathered round her and with Alsace-Lorraine
restored. We covet no French possession; we have no acquisitive
appetites or ambitions in North Africa or any other part of the
world. We have not entered this war for profit or expansion, but
only for honour and to do our duty in defending the right.
Let me, however, make this clear, in case there should be any
mistake about it in any quarter. We mean to hold our own. I have
not become the King's First Minister in order to preside over the
liquidation of the British Empire. For that task, if ever it were
prescribed, someone else would have to be found, and, under
democracy, I suppose the nation would have to be consulted. I am
proud to be a member of that vast commonwealth and society of
nations and communities gathered in and around the ancient British
monarchy, without which the good cause might well have perished
from the face of the earth. Here we are, and here we stand, a
veritable rock of salvation in this drifting world. "
"'The frontiers of deliverance', 29 November 1942, World Broadcast, London",,"Two Sundays ago all the bells rang to celebrate the victory of our
desert Army at Alamein. Here was a martial episode in British history
which deserved a special recognition. But the bells also carried with
their clashing joyous peals our thanksgiving that, in spite of all our
errors and shortcomings, we have been brought nearer to the
frontiers of deliverance ....
Since we rang the bells for Alamein, the good cause has prospered.
The Eighth Army has advanced nearly four hundred miles, driving
before them in rout and ruin the powerful forces, or the remnants of
the powerful forces, which Rommel boasted and Hitler and Mussolini believed would conquer Egypt. Another serious battle may be
impending at the entrance to Tripolitania. I make it a rule not to
prophesy about battles before they are fought. Everyone must try to
realise the immense distances over which the North African war
ranges, and the enormous labours and self-denial of the troops who
press forward relentlessly, twenty, thirty, forty and sometimes fifty
miles in a single day. I will say no more than that we may have the
greatest confidence in Generals Alexander and Montgomery, and in
our soldiers and airmen who have at last begun to come into their
own.
At the other side of Africa, a thousand miles or more to the
westward, the tremendous joint undertaking of the United States and
Britain which was fraught with so many hazards has also been
crowned with astonishing success. To transport these large armies of
several hundred thousand men, with all their intricate elaborate
modern apparatus, secretly across the seas and oceans, and to strike
to the hour, and almost to the minute, simultaneously at a dozen
points, in spite of all the U-boats and all the chances of weather, was
a feat of organisation which will long be studied with respect. It was
rendered possible only by one sovereign fact - namely the perfect
comradeship and understanding prevailing between the British and
American staffs and troops. This majestic enterprise is under the direction and responsibility of the President of the United States, and
our First British Army is serving under the orders of the American
Commander-in-Chief, General Eisenhower, in whose military skill
and burning energy we put our faith, and whose orders to attack we
shall punctually and unflinchingly obey. Behind all lies the power of
the Royal Navy, to which is joined a powerful American Fleet; the
whole under the command of Admiral Cunningham, and all
subordinated to the Allied Commander-in-Chief ....
The ceaseless flow of good news from every theatre of war, which
has filled the whole month of November, confronts the British people
with a new test. They have proved that they can stand defeat; they
have proved that they can bear with fortitude and confidence long
periods of unsatisfactory and unexplained inaction. I see no reason at
all why we should not show ourselves equally resolute and active in
the face of victory. I promise nothing. I predict nothing. I cannot
even guarantee that more successes are not on the way. I commend to
all the immortal lines of Kipling:
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same -
there is my text for this Sunday'S sermon, though I have no licence to
preach one. Do not let us be led away by any fair-seeming
appearances of fortune; let us rather put our trust in those deep,
slow-moving tides that have borne us thus far already, and will
surely bear us forward, if we know how to use them, until we reach
the harbour where we would be. "
"'The Desert Army', 3 February 1943, Tripoli",,"The last time I saw this army was in the closing days of August on those sandy and rocky bluffs near Alamein and the Ruweisat ridge, when it was apparent from all the signs that Rommel was about to make his final thrust on Alexandria and Cairo. Then all was to be won or lost. Now I come to you a long way from Alamein, and I find this army and its famous commander with a record of victory behind it which has undoubtedly played a decisive part in altering the whole character of the war. The fierce and well-fought battle of Alamein, the blasting through of the enemy's seaward flank, and the thunderbolt of the armoured attack, irretrievably broke the army which Rommel had boasted would conquer Egypt, and upon which the German and Italian peoples had set their hopes. Thereafter and ever since, in these remorseless three months, you have chased t~is hostile army and driven it from pillar to post over a distance of more than 1,400 miles - in fact, as far as from London to Moscow. You have altered the face of the war in a most remarkable way. What it has meant in the skill and organisation of movement and manoeuvres, what it has meant in the tireless endurance and selfdenial Qf the troops and in the fearless leadership displayed in action, can be appreciated only by those who were actually on the spot. But I must tell you that the fame of the Desert Army has spread throughout the world. After the surrender of Tobruk, there was a dark period when many people, not knowing us, not knowing the British and the nations of the British Empire, were ready to take a disparaging view. But now everywhere your work is spoken of with respect and admiration. When I was with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff at Casablanca and with the President of the United States, the arrival of the Desert Army in Tripoli was a new factor which influenced the course of our discussions and opened up hopeful vistas for the future. You are entitled to know these things, and to dwell upon them with that satisfaction which men in all modesty feel when a great work has been finally done. You have rendered a high service to your country and the common cause. It must have been a tremendous experience driving forward day after day over this desert which it has taken me this morning more
than six hours to fly at 200 miles an hour. You were pursuing a
broken enemy, dragging on behind you this ever-lengthening line of
communications, carrying the whole art of desert warfare to
perfection. In the words of the old hymn, you have 'nightly pitched
your moving tents a day's march nearer home.' Yes, not only in the
march of the army but in the progress of the war you have brought
home nearer. I am here to thank you on behalf of His Majesty's
Government of the British Isles and of all our friends the world over.
Hard struggles lie ahead. Rommel, the fugitive of Egypt, Cyrenaica, and Tripolitania, in a non-stop race of 1,400 miles, is now trying
to present himself as the deliverer of Tunisia. Along the eastern coast
of Tunisia are large numbers of German and Italian troops, not yet
equipped to their previous standard, but growing stronger. On the
other side, another great operation, planned in conjunction with
your advance, has carried the First British Army, our American
comrades, and the French armies to within 30 or 40 miles of Bizerta
and Tunis. Therefrom a military situation arises which everyone can
understand.
The days of your victories are by no means at an end, and with
forces which march from different quarters we may hope to achieve
the final destruction or expulsion from the shores of Africa of every
armed German or Italian. You must have felt relief when, after those
many a hundred miles of desert, you came once more into a green
land with trees and grass, and I do not think you will lose that
advantage. As you go forward on further missions that will fall to
your lot, you will fight in countries which will present undoubtedly
serious tactical difficulties, but which none the less will not have that
grim character of desert war which you have known how to endure
and how to overcome.
Let me then assure you, soldiers and airmen, that your fellowcountrymen regard your joint work with admiration and gratitude,
and that after the war when a man is asked what he did it will be
quite sufficient for him to say, 'I marched and fought with the Desert
Army.' And when history is written and all the facts are known, your
feats will gleam and glow and will be a source of song and story long
after we who are gathered here have passed away. "
"Tribute to Montgomery and Alexander, 11 February 1943, House of Commons",,"Let me also pay my tribute to this vehement and formidable General Montgomery, a Cromwellian figure, austere, severe, accomplished, tireless, his life given to the study of war, who has attracted to himself in an extraordinary measure the confidence and the devotion of his Army. Let me also pay, in the name of the House, my tribute to General Alexander, on whom the overriding responsibility lay. I read to the House on 11th November the directive which in those critical days I gave to General Alexander. I may perhaps refresh the memory of hon. Members by reading it again: 1. Your prime and main duty will be to take or destroy at the earliest opportunity the German-Italian army commanded by Field-Marshal Rommel, together with all its supplies and establishments in Egypt and Libya. 2. You will discharge, or cause to be discharged, such other duties as pertain to your Command without prejudice to the task described in paragraph 1, which must be considered paramount in His Majesty's interests. I have now received, when, as it chanced, I visited the Army again, the following official communication from General Alexander, in which General Montgomery took great pleasure, and to which it will be necessary for us to send. a reply: Sir, The Orders you gave me on August 15, 1942, have been fulfilled. His Majesty's enemies, together with their impedimenta, have been completely eliminated from Egypt, Cyrenaica, Libya and Tripolitania. I now await your further instructions. Well, obviously, we shall have to think of something else, and, indeed, this was one of the more detailed matters which we discussed in the Conference at Casablanca. I did not publish the original instructions to General Alexander until some months afterwards, when the Battle of Egypt had been won, and the House will naturally grant me a similar delay before I make public the reply to him which
is now required. "
"Heavier work lies ahead', 19 May 1943, Congress, Washington, DC",,"Seventeen months have passed since I last had the honour to address the Congress of the United States. For more than 500 days, every day a day, we have toiled and suffered and dared shoulder to shoulder against the cruel and mighty enemy. We have acted in close combination or concert in many parts of the world, on land, on sea, and in the air. The fact that you have invited me to come to Congress again a second time, now that we have settled down to the job, and that you should welcome me in so generous a fashion, is certainly a high mark in my life, and it also shows that our partnership has not done so badly. I am proud that you should have found us good allies, striving forward in comradeship to the accomplishment of our task without grudging or stinting either life or treasure, or, indeed, anything that we have to give. Last time I came at a moment when the United States was aflame with wrath at the treacherous attack upon Pearl Harbor by Japan, and at the subsequent declarations of war upon the United States made by Germany and Italy. For my part I say quite frankly that in those days, after our long - and for a whole year lonely - struggle, I could not repress in my heart a sense of relief and comfort that we were all bound together by common peril, by
solemn faith and high purpose, to see this fearful quarrel through, at
all costs, to the end.
That was the hour of passionate emotion, an hour most memorable in human records, an hour, I believe, full of hope and glory for
the future. The experiences of a long life and the promptings of my
blood have wrought in me the conviction that there is nothing more
important for the future of the world than the fraternal association of
our two peoples in righteous work both in war and peace ....
I am free to admit that in North Africa we builded better than we
knew. The unexpected came to the aid of the design and multiplied
the results. For this we have to thank the military intuition of
Corporal Hitler. We may notice, as I predicted in the House of
Commons three months ago, the touch of the master hand. The same
insensate obstinacy which condemned Field-Marshal von Paulus and
his army to destruction at Stalingrad has brought this new catastrophe upon our enemies in Tunisia.
We have destroyed. or captured considerably more than a quarter
of a million of the eneJJ1Y's best troops, together with vast masses of
material, all of which had been ferried across to Africa after paying a
heavy toll to British submarines and British and United States
aircraft. No one could count on such follies. They gave us, if I may
use the language of finance, a handsome bonus after the full dividend
had been earned and paid.
At the time when we planned this great joint African operation, we
hoped to be masters of Tunisia even before the end of last year; but
the injury we have now inflicted upon the enemies, physical and
psychological, and the training our troops have obtained in the hard
school of war, and the welding together of the Anglo-American Staff
machine - these are advantages which far exceed anything which it
was in our power to plan. The German lie factory is volubly
explaining how valuable is the time which they bought by the loss of
their great armies. Let them not delude themselves. Other operations
which will unfold in due course, depending as they do upon the
special instruction of large numbers of troops and upon the provision
of a vast mass of technical apparatus, these other operations have not
been in any way delayed by the obstinate fighting in northern
Tunisia.
Mr President, the African war is over. Mussolini's African Empire
and Corporal Hitler's strategy are alike exploded. It is interesting to
compute what these performances have cost these two wicked men
and those who have been their tools or their dupes. The Emperor of Abyssinia sits again upon the throne from which he was driven by
Mussolini's poison gas. All the vast territories from Madagascar to
Morocco, fwm Cairo to Casablanca, from Aden to Dakar, are under
British, American, or French control. One continent at least has been
cleansed and purged for ever from Fascist or Nazi tyranny.
The African excursions of the two Dictators have cost their
countries in killed and captured 950,000 soldiers. In addition nearly
2,400,000 gross tons of shipping have been sunk and nearly 8,000
aircraft destroyed, both of these figures being exclusive of large
numbers of ships and aircraft damaged. There have also been lost to
the enemy 6,200 guns, 2,550 tanks and 70,000 trucks, which is the
American name for lorries, and which, I understand, has been
adopted by the combined staffs in North-West Africa in exchange for
the use of the word petrol in place of gasolene.
These are the losses of the enemy in the three years of war, and at
the end of it all what is it that they have to show? The proud German
Army has by its sudden collapse, sudden crumbling and breaking up,
unexpected to all of us, the proud German Army has once again
proved the truth of the saying, 'The Hun is always either at your
throat or at your feet'; and that is a point which may have its bearing
upon the future. But for us, arrived at this milestone in the war: we
can say 'One Continent redeemed'.
The North-West African campaign, and particularly its Tunisian
climax, is the finest example of the co-operation of the troops of
three different countries and of the combination under one supreme
commander of the sea, land, and air forces which has yet been seen:
in particular the British and American Staff work, as I have said, has
matched the comradeship of the soldiers of our two countries
striding forward side by side under the fire of the enemy.
It was a marvel of efficient organisation which enabled the Second
American Corps, or rather Army, for that was its size, to be moved
300 miles from the Southern sector, which had become obsolete
through the retreat of the enemy, to the Northern coast, from which,
beating down all opposition, they advanced and took the fortress
and harbour of Bizerta. In order to accomplish this march of 300
miles, which was covered in twelve days, it was necessary for this
very considerable Army, with its immense modern equipment, to
traverse at right angles all the communications of the British First
Army, which was already engaged or about to be engaged in heavy
battle; and this was achieved without in any way disturbing the hourto-hour supply upon which that Army depended. I am told that these
British and American officers worked together without the slightest question of what country they belonged to, each doing his part in the
military organisation which must henceforward be regarded as a
most powerful and efficient instrument of war.
There is honour, Mr President, for all; and I shall at the proper
time and place pay my tribute to the British and American
commanders by land and ~ea who conducted or who were engaged
in the battle. This only will I say now: I do not think you could have
chosen any man more capable than General Eisenhower of keeping
his very large, heterogeneous force together, through bad times as
well as good, and of creating the cOflditions of harmony and energy
which were the indispensable elements of victory.
I have dwelt in some detail, but I trust not at undue length, upon
these famous events; and I shall now return for a few minutes to the
general war, in which they have their setting and proportion. It is a
poor heart that never rejoices; but our thanksgiving, however
fervent, must be brief.
Heavier work lies ahead, pot only in the European, but, as I have
indicated, in the Pacific and Indian spheres; and the President and I,
and the combined Staffs, are gathered here in order that this work
may be, so far as lies within us, well conceived, and thrust forward
without losing a day.
Not for one moment must we forget that the main burden of the
war on land is still being borne by the Russian armies. They are
holding at the present time no fewer than 190 German divisions and
28 satellite divisions 0:1 their front. It is always wise, while doing
justice to one's own achievements, to preserve a proper sense of
proportion; and I therefore mention that the figures of the German
forces opposite Russia compare with the equivalent of about 15
divisions which we have destroyed in Tunisia, after a campaign
which has cost us about 50,000 casualties. That gives some measure
of the Russian effort, and of the debt which we owe to her.
It may well be that a further trial of strength between the German
and Russian armies is impending. Russia has already inflicted injuries
upon the German military organism which will, I believe, prove
ultimately mortal; but there is little doubt that Hitler is reserving his
supreme gambler'S throw for a third attempt to break the heart and
spirit and destroy the armed forces of the mighty nation which he has
already twice assaulted in vain.
He will not succeed. But we must do everything in our power that
is sensible and practicable to take more of the weight off Russia in
1943. I do not intend to be responsible for any suggestion that the war is won, or that it will soon be over. That it will be won by us I
am sure. But how and when cannot be foreseen, still less foretold.
I was driving the other day not far from the field of Gettysburg,
which J know well, like most of your battlefields. It was the decisive
battle of the American Civil War. No one after Gettysburg doubted
which way the dread balance of war would incline, yet far more
blood was shed after the Union victory at Gettysburg than in all the
fighting which went before. It behoves us, therefore, to search our
hearts and brace our si11ews and take the most earnest counsel, one
with another, in order that the favourable position which has already
been reached both against Japan and against Hitler and Mussolini in
Europe shall not be let slip.
If we wish to abridge the slaughter and ruin which this war is
spreading to so many lands and to which we must ourselves
contribute so grievous a measure of suffering and sacrifice, we cannot
afford to relax a single fibre of our being or to tolerate the slightest
abatement of our efforts. The enemy is still proud and powerful. He
is hard to get at. He still possesses enormous armies, vast resources,
and invaluable strategic ::erritories. War is full of mysteries and
surprises. A false step, a wrong direction, an error in strategy, discord
or lassitude among the Allies, might soon give the common enemy
power to confront us with new and hideous facts. We have
surmounted many serious dangers, but there is one grave danger
which will go along with us till the end; that danger is the undue
prolongation of the war. No one can tell what new complications
and perils might arise in four or five more years of war. And it is in
the dragging-out of the war at enormous expense, until the
democracies are tired or bored or split, that the main hopes of
Germany and Japan must now reside. We must destroy this hope, as
we have destroyed so many others, and for that purpose we must
beware of every topic however attractive and every tendency
however natural which turns our minds and energies from this
supreme objective of the general victory of the United Nations. By
singleness of purpose, by steadfastness of conduct, by tenacity and
endurance such as we have so far displayed - by these, and only by
these, can we discharge our duty to the future of the world and to the
destiny of man. "
"'We expect no reward', 30 June 1943, Guildhall, London",,"Of all the wars that we have ever waged in the long continuity of our history, there has never been one which more truly united the entire British nation and British race throughout the world than this present fearful struggle for the freedom and progress of mankind. We entered it of our own free will, without being ourselves directly assaulted. We entered it upon a conviction of purpose which was clearly comprehended by all classes and parties and by the whole mass of the people, and we have persevered together through good and evil fortune without the slightest weakening of our willpower or division of our strength. We entered it ill-prepared and almost unarmed. We entered it without counting the cost, and upon a single spontaneous impulse at the call of honour. We strove long, too long, for peace, and suffered thereby; but from the moment when we gave our guarantee that we would not stand by idly and see Poland trampled down by Nazi violence, we have never looked back, never flagged, never doubted, never flinched. We were sure of our duty, and we have discharged it and will discharge it, without swerving or slackening, to the end. We seek no profit, we covet no territory or aggrandisement. We expect no reward and we will accept no compromise. It is on that footing that we wish to be judged, first in our own consciences and afterwards by posterity. It is even more remarkable that the unity which has existed and endured in this small, densely-populated island should have extended with equal alacrity and steadfastness to all parts of our worldwide Comrr..onwealth and Empire .... Alone in history, the British people, taught by the lessons they had learned in the past, have found the means to attach to the Motherland vast self-governing Dominions upon whom there rests no obligation, other than that of sentiment and tradition, to plunge into war at the side of the Motherland. None of these Dominions, except Southern Ireland, which does not under its present dispensation fully accept Dominion status, has
ever failed to respond, with all the vigour of democratic institutions,
to the trumpet-call of a supreme crisis, to the overpowering
influences and impulses that make Canada, that make Australia ...
New Zealand and South Africa send their manhood across the ocean
to fight and die ....
But now I must speak of the great Republic of the United States,
whose power arouses no fear and whose pre-eminence excites no
jealousy in British bosoms. Upon the fraternal association and
intimate alignment of policy of the United States and the British
Commonwealth and Empire depends, more than on any other factor,
the immediate future of the world. If they walk, or if need be march,
together in harmony and in accordance with the moral and political
conceptions to which the English-speaking peoples have given birth,
and which are frequently referred to in the Atlantic Charter, all will
be well. If they fall apart and wander astray from the commanding
beacon-light of their destiny, there is no end or measure to the
miseries and confusiorl which await modern civilisation. "
"'The gift of a common tongue', 6 September 1943, Harvard, Boston",,"Twice in my lifetime the long arm of destiny has searched across the oceans and involved the entire life and manhood of the United States in a deadly struggle. There was no use in saying 'We don't want it; we won't have it; our forebears left Europe to avoid these quarrels; we have founded a new world which has no contact with the old.' There was no use in that. The long arm reaches out remorselessly, and everyone's existence, environment, and outlook undergo a swift and irresistible change. What is the explanation, Mr President, of these strange facts, and what are the deep laws to which they respond? I will offer you one explanation - there are others, but one
will suffice. The price of greatness is responsibility. If the people of
the United States had continued in a mediocre station, struggling
with the wilderness, absorbed in their own affairs, and a factor of no
consequence in the movement of the world, they might have
remained forgotten and undisturbed beyond their protecting oceans:
but one cannot rise to be in many ways the leading community in the
civilised world without being involved in its problems, without being
convulsed by its agonies and inspired by its causes.
If this has been proved in the past, as it has been, it will become
indisputable in the future. The people of the United States cannot
escape world responsibility. Although we live in a period so
tumultuous that little can be predicted we may be quite sure that this
process will be intensified with every forward step the United States
make in wealth and in power. ...
But to the youth of America, as to the youth of Britain, I say 'You
cannot stop.' There is no halting-place at this point. We have now
reached a stage in the journey where there can be no pause. We must
go on. It must be world anarchy or world order. Throughout all this
ordeal and struggle which is characteristic of our age, you will find in
the British Commonwealth and Empire good comrades to whom you
are united by other ties besides those of State policy and public need.
To a large extent, they are the ties of blood and history. Naturally, I,
a child of both worlds, am conscious of these.
Law, language, literature - these are considerable factors. Common conceptions of what is right and decent, a marked regard for
fair play, especially to the weak and poor, a stern sentiment of
impartial justice, and above all the love of personal freedom, or as
Kipling put it; 'Leave to live by no man's leave underneath the law' -
these are common conceptions on both sides of the ocean among the
English-speaking peoples. We hold to these conceptions as strongly
as you do.
We do not war primarily with races as such. Tyranny is our foe,
whatever trappings or disguise it wears, whatever language it speaks,
be it external or internal, we must for ever be on our guard, ever
mobilised, ever vigilant, always ready to spring at its throat. In all
this, we march together. Not only do we march and strive shoulder
to shoulder at this moment under the fire of the enemy on the fields
of war or in the air, but also in those realms of thought which are
consecrated to the rights and the dignity of man ....
The great Bismarck - for there were once great men in Germanyis said to have observed towards the close of his life that the most potent factor in human society at the end of the nineteenth century
was the fact that the British and American peoples spoke the same
language. That was a pregnant saying. Certainly it has enabled us to
wage war together with an intimacy and harmony never before
achieved among allies.
The gift of a common tongue is a priceless inheritance and it may
well some day become the foundation of a common citizenship. I like
to think of British and Americans moving about freely over each
other's wide estates with hardly a sense of being foreigners to one
another. But I do not see why we should not try to spread our
common language even more widely throughout the globe and,
without seeking selfish advantage over any, possess ourselves of this
invaluable amenity and birthright."
"'A sense of crowd and urgency', 28 October 1943, House of Commons",,"I beg to move,
That a Select Committee be appointed to consider and report upon
plans for the rebuilding of the House of Commons, and upon such
alterations as may be considered desirable while preserving all its
essential features.
On the night of 10th May, 1941, with one of the last bombs of the
last serious raid, our House of Commons was destroyed by the
violence of the enemy, and we have now to consider whether we
should build it up again, and how, and when. We shape our
buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us. Having dwelt and
served for more than forty years in the late Chamber, and having
derived very great pleasure and advantage therefrom, I, naturally,
should like to see it restored in all essentials to its old form,
convenience, and dignity. I believe that will be the opinion of the great majority of its Members. It is certainly the OpInIOn of His
Majesty's Government, and we propose to support this Resolution to
the best of our ability.
There are two main characteristics of the House of Commons
which will command the approval and the support of reflective and
experienced Members. They will, I have no doubt, sound odd to
foreign ears. The first is that its shape should be oblong and not semicircular. Here is a very potent factor in our political life. The semicircular assembly, which appeals to political theorists, enables every
individual or every group to move round the centre, adopting various
shades of pink according as the weather changes. I am a convinced
supporter of the party system in preference to the group system. I
have seen many earnest and ardent Parliaments destroyed by the
group system. The party system is much favoured by the oblong form
of Chamber. It is easy for an individual to move through those
insensible gradations from Left to Right, but the act of crossing the
Floor is one which requires serious consideration. I am well informed
on this matter, for! have accomplished that difficult process, not
only once but twice. Logic is a poor guide compared with custom.
Logic, which has created in so many countries semi-circular
assemblies with buildings that give to every Member, not only a seat
to sit in, but often a desk to write at, with a lid to bang, has proved
fatal in Parliamentarv Government as we know it here in its home
and in the land of its birth.
The second characteristic of a Chamber formed on the lines of the
House of Commons is that it should not be big enough to contain all
its Members at once without overcrowding, and that there should be
no question of every Member having a separate seat reserved for him.
The reason for this has long been a puzzle to uninstructed outsiders,
and has frequently excited the curiosity and even the criticism of new
Members. Yet is not so difficult to understand if you look at it from a
practical point of view. If the House is big enough to contain all its
Members, nine-tenths of its Debates will be conducted in the
depressing atmosphere of an almost empty or half-empty Chamber.
The essence of good House of Commons speaking is the conversational style, the facility for quick, informal interruptions and interchanges. Harangues from a rostrum would be a bad substitute for the
conversational style in which so much of our business is done. But the
conversational style requires a fairly small space, and there should be
on great occasions a sense of crowd and urgency. There should be a
sense of the importance of much that is said, and a sense that great
matters are being decided, there and then, by the House. We attach immense importance to the survival of Parliamentary
democracy. In this country this is one of our war aims. We wish to
see our Parliament a strong, easy, flexible instrument of free Debate.
For this purpose a small Chamber and a sense of intimacy are
indispensable. It is notable that the Parliaments of the British
Commonwealth have to a very large extent reproduced our Parliamentary institutions in their form as well as in their spirit, even to the
Chair in which the Speakers of the different Assemblies sit. We do
not seek to impose our ideas on others; we make no invidious
criticisms of other nations. All the same we hold none the less
tenaciously to them ourselves. The vitality and the authority of the
House of Commons, and its hold upon an electorate based upon
universal suffrage, depend to no small extent upon its episodes and
great moments, even upon its scenes and rows, which, as everyone
will agree, are better conducted at close quarters. Destroy that hold
which Parliament has upon the public mind and has preserved
through all these changing, turbulent times, and the living organism
of the House of Common[ would be greatly impaired. You may have
a machine, but the House of Commons is much more than a
machine; it has earned and captured and held through long
generations the imagination and respect of the British nation. It is not
free from shortcomings; they mark all human institutions. Nevertheless, I submit to what is probably not an unfriendly audience on that
subject that our House has proved itself capable of adapting itself to
every change which the swift pace of modern life has brought upon
us. It has a collective per!.onality which enjoys the regard of the
public, and which imposes itself upon the conduct not only of
individual Members but of parties. It has a code of its own which
everyone knows, and it has means of its own of enforcing those
manners and habits which have grown up and have been found to be
an essential part of our Parliamentary life.
The House of Commons has lifted our affairs above the mechanical sphere into the human sphere. It thrives on criticism, it is perfectly
impervious to newspaper abuse or taunts from any quarter, and it is
capable of digesting almost anything or almost any body of
gentlemen, whatever be the views with which they arrive. There is no
situation to which it cannot address itself with vigour and ingenuity.
It is the citadel of British liberty; it is the foundation of our laws; its
traditions and its privileges are as lively today as when it broke the
arbitrary power of the Crown and substituted that Constitutional
Monarchy under which we have enjoyed so many blessings. In this
war the House of Commons has proved itself to be a rock upon which an Administration, without losing the confidence of the
House, has been able to confront the most terrible emergencies. The
House has shown itself able to face the possibility of national
destruction with classical composure. It can change Governments,
and has changed them by heat of passion. It can sustain Governments in long, adverse, disappointing struggles through many dark,
grey months and even years until the sun comes out again. I do not
know how else this country can be governed than by the House of
Commons playing its part in all its broad freedom in British public
life. We have learned - with these so recently confirmed facts around
us and before us - not to alter improvidently the physical structures
which have enabled so remarkable an organism to carryon its work
of banning dictatorships within this Island, and pursuing and beating
into ruins all dictators who have molested us from outside. "
"'The hour of our greatest effort', 26 March 1944, Broadcast, London",,"The hour of our greatest effort and action is approaching. We march with valiant Allies who count on us as we count on them. The flashing eyes of all our soldiers, sailors, and airmen must be fixed upon the enemy on their front. The only homeward road for all of us lies through the arch of victory. The magnificent Armies of the United States are here or are pouring in. Our own troops, the best trained and best equipped we have ever had, stand at their side in equal numbers and in true comradeship. Leaders are appointed in whom we all have faith. We shall require from our own people here, from Parliament, from the Press, from all classes, the same cool, strong nerves, the same toughness of fibre, which stood us in good
stead in those days when we were all alone under the blitz.
And here I must warn you that in order to deceive and baffle the
enemy as well as to exercise the forces, there will be many false
alarms, many feints, and many dress rehearsals. We may also
ourselves be the object of new forms of attack from the enemy.
Britain can take it. She has never flinched or failed. And when the
signal is given, the whole circle of avenging nations will hurl
themselves upon the foe and batter out the life of the cruellest
tyranny which has ever sought to bar the progress of mankind. "
"D-Day, 6 June 1944, House of Commons",,"The House should, I think, take formal cognisance of the liberation of Rome by the Allied Armies under the command of General Alexander, with General Clark of the United States Service and General Oliver Leese in command of the Fifth and Eighth Armies respectively. This is a memorable and glorious event, which rewards the intense fighting of the last five months in Italy .... I have also to announce to the House that during the night and the early hours of this morning the first of the series of landings in force upon the European Continent has taken place. In this case the liberating assault fell upon the coast of France. An immense armada of upwards of 4,000 ships, together with several thousand smaller craft, crossed the Channel. Massed airborne landings have been successfully effected behind the enemy lines, and landings on the beaches are proceeding at various points at the present time. The fire of the shore batteries has been largely quelled. The obstacles that were constructed in the sea have not proved so difficult as was apprehended. The Anglo-American Allies are sustained by about 11,000 first-line aircraft, which can be drawn upon as may be needed for the purposes of the battle. I cannot, of course, commit myself to any particular details. Reports are coming in in rapid succession. So
far the commanders who are engaged report that everything is
proceeding according to plan. And what a plan! This vast operation
is undoubtedly the most complicated and difficult that has ever taken
place. It involves tides, wind, waves, visibility, both from the air and
the sea standpoint, and the combined employment of land, air and
sea forces in the highest degree of intimacy and in contact with
conditions which could not and cannot be fully foreseen.
There are already hopes that actual tactical surprise has been
attained, and we hope to furnish the enemy with a succession of
surprises during the course of the fighting. The battle that has now
begun will grow constantly in scale and in intensity for many weeks
to come, and I shall not attempt to speculate upon its course. This I
may say, however. Complete unity prevails throughout the Allied
Armies. There is a brotherhood in arms between us and our friends
of the United States. There is complete confidence in the supreme
commander, General Eisenhower, and his lieutenants, and also in the
commander of the Expeditionary Force, General Montgomery. The
ardour and spirit of the troops, as I saw myself, embarking in these
last few days was splendid to witness. "
"The price in blood ... for the soil of France', 28 September 1944, House of Commons",,"Little more than seven weeks have passed since we rose for the
summer vacation, but this short period has completely changed the
face of the war in Europe. When we separated, the Anglo-American
Armies were still penned in the narrow bridgehead and strip of coast
from the base of the Cherbourg Peninsula to the approaches to Caen,
which they had wrested from the enemy several weeks before. The
Brest Peninsula was untaken, the German Army in the West was still hopeful of preventing us from striking out into the fields of France,
the Battle of Normandy, which had been raging bloodily from the
date of the landing, had not reached any decisive conclusion. What a
transformation now meets our eyes! Not only Paris, but practically
the whole of France, has been liberated as if by enchantment.
Belgium has been rescued, part of Holland is already free, and the
foul enemy, who for four years inflicted his cruelties and oppression
upon these countries, has fled, losing perhaps 400,000 in killed and
wounded, and leaving in our hands nearly half a million prisoners.
Besides this, there may well be 200,000 cut off in the coastal
fortresses or in Holland, whose destruction or capture may now be
deemed highly probable. The Allied Armies have reached and in
some places crossed the German frontier and the Siegfried Line.
All these operations have been conducted under the supreme
command of General Eisenhower, and were the fruit of the worldfamous battle of Normandy, the greatest and most decisive single
battle of the entire war. Never has the exploitation of victory been
carried to a higher perfection. The chaos and destruction wrought by
the Allied Air Forces behind the battle front have been indescribable
in narrative, and a factor of the utmost potency in the actual struggle.
They have far surpassed, and reduce to petty dimensions, all that our
army had to suffer from the German Air Force in 1940. Nevertheless,
when we reflect upon the tremendous fire-power of modern weapons
and the opportunity which they give for defensive and delaying
action, we must feel astounded at the extraordinary speed with
which the Allied Armies have advanced. The vast and brilliant
encircling movement of the American Armies will ever be a model of
military art, and an example of the propriety of running risks not
only in the fighting - because most of the armies are ready to do that
- but even more on the Q. side, or, as the Americans put it, the
logistical side. It was with great pleasure that all of us saw the British
and Canadian Armies, who had so long fought against heavy
resistance by the enemy along the hinge of the Allied movement,
show themselves also capable of lightning advances which have
certainly not been surpassed anywhere.
Finally, by the largest airborne operation ever conceived or
executed, a further all-important forward bound in the North has
been achieved. Here I must pay a tribute, which the House will
consider due, to the superb feat of arms performed by our First
Airborne Division. Full and deeply-moving accounts have already
been given to the country and to the world of this glorious and
fruitful operation, which VJill take a lasting place in our military annals, and will, in succeeding generations, inspire our youth with
the highest ideals of duty and of daring. The cost has been heavy; the
casualties in a single division have been grievous; but for those who
mourn there is at least the consolation that the sacrifice was not
needlessly demanded nor given without results. The delay caused to
the enemy's advance upon Nijmegen enabled their British and
American comrades in the other two airborne divisions, and the
British Second Army, to secure intact the vitally important bridges
and to form a strong bridgehead over the main stream of the Rhine
at Nijmegen. 'Not in vain' may be the pride of those who have
survived and the epitaph of those who fell.
To return to the main theme, Brest, Havre, Dieppe, Boulogne and
Antwerp are already in our hands. All the Atlantic and Channel
ports, from the Spanish frontier to the Hook of Holland, will
presently be in our possession, yielding fine harbours and substantial
masses of prisoners of war. All this has been accomplished by the
joint exertions of the British and American Armies, assisted by the
vehement and widespread uprising and fighting efforts of the French
Maquis.
While this great operation has been taking its course, an American
and French landing on the Riviera coast, actively assisted by a British
airborne brigade, a British Air Force, and the Royal Navy, has led
with inconceivable rapidity to the capture of Toulon and Marseilles,
to the freeing of the great strip of the Riviera coast, and to the
successful advance of General Patch's Army up the Rhone Valley.
This army, after takmg over 80,000 prisoners, joined hands with
General Eisenhower, and has passed under his command. When I
had the opportunity on 15th August of watching - alas, from afarthe landing at Saint Tropez, it would have seemed audacious to hope
for such swift and important results. They have, however, under the
spell of the victories in the North, already been gained in superabundance, and in less than half the time prescribed and expected in the
plans which were prepared beforehand. So much for the fighting in
France.
Simultaneously with that, very hard and successful fighting on a
majo1."" scale has also proceeded on the Italian Front. General
Alexander, who commands the armies in Italy with complete
operational discretion, has under him the Fifth and Eighth Armies.
The Fifth Army, half American and half British, with whom are
serving the fine Brazilian Division, some of whose troops I had the
opportunity of seeing - a magnificent band of men - is commanded
by the United States General Clark, an officer of the highest quality and bearing, with a proud record of achievments behind him and his
troops. The Eighth Army, under General Oliver Leese, whose
qualities are also of the highest order, comprises the Polish Corps
which fought so gallantly under General Anders, and a Greek
Brigade which has already distinguished itself in the forefront of the
battle. There is also fighting on this Front a strong force of Italians,
who are ardent to free their country from the German grip and taint.
This force will very soon be more than doubled in strength. The
Lieutenant of the Realm is often with these troops.
The largest mass of all the troops on the Italian Front comes, of
course, from the United Kingdom. Not far short of half the divisions
on the whole front are from this Island. Joined with them are New
Zealand, Canadian, South African and Indian Divisions, or perhaps I
should say British-Indian Divisions, because, as is sometimes forgotten, one-third of them are British. The British Army in Italy includes
also Palestinian units; and here I would mention the announcement,
which I think will be appreciated and approved, that the Government have decided to accede to the request of the Jewish Agency for
Palestine that a Jewish Brig2.de group should be formed to take part
in active operations. I know there are vast numbers of Jews serving
with our Forces and the American Forces throughout all the Armies,
but it seems to me indeed appropriate that a special Jewish unit, a
special unit of that race which has suffered indescribable torments
from the Nazis, should be represented as a distinct formation
amongst the forces gathered for their final overthrow, and I have no
doubt they will not only take part in the struggle but also in the
occupation which will follow.
A very hard task lies before the Army in Italy. It has already
pierced at several points the strong Gothic line by which Kesselring
has sought to defend the passage of the Apennines. I had an
opportunity of watching and following the advance of the Eighth
Army across the Metauro River, which began on August 26th. The
extraordinary defensive strength of the ground held by the enemy
was obvious. The mountain ridges rise one behind the other in a
seemingly endless succession, like the waves of the sea, and each had
to be conquered or turned by superior force and superior weapons.
The process was bound to be lengthy and costly, but it is being
completed, has, in fact, been practically completed. At the same time,
General Clark's Fifth Army, advancing from the Florence area, has
pierced deep into the mountain ranges, and, having broken the
enemy's centre, now stands on the northern slopes of the Apennines
at no great distance from Bologna, a place of definite strategic importance. General Alexander has now definitely broken into the
basin of the Po, but here we exchange the barriers of mountain ridges
for the perpetual interruption of the ground by streams and canals.
Nevertheless, conditions henceforward will be more favourable for
the destruction or rout of Kesselring's Army, and this is the objective
to which all British and Allied Forces will be unceasingly bent.
Farther than that, it is not desirable to peer at the present moment.
I am now going to give a few facts and figures about the operations
in Europe. These have been very carefully chosen to give as much
information as possible to the House and to the public, while not
telling the enemy anything he does not already know, or only telling
him too late for it to be of any service to him. The speed with which
the mighty British and American Armies in France were built up is
almost incredible. In the first 24 hours a quarter of a million men
were landed, in the teeth of fortified and violent opposition. By the
20th day a million men were ashore. There are now between two and
three million men in France. Certainly the progress in the power of
moving troops and landing troops has vastly increased since the early
days, when we had to plunge into the war with no previous
experience. But the actual number of soldiers was only part of the
problem of transportation. These armies were equipped with the
most perfect modern weapons and every imaginable contrivance of
modern war, and an immense artillery supported all their operations.
Enormous masses of armour of the highest quality and character
gave them extraordinary offensive power and mobility. Many
hundreds of thousands of vehicles sustained their movements, many
millions of tons of stores have already been landed - the great bulk of
everything over opep.. beaches or through the synthetic harbours
which I described when last I spoke to the House.
All this constitutes a feat of organisation and efficiency which
should excite the wonder and deserve the admiration of all military
students, as well as the applause of the British and American nations
and their Allies. I must pay my tribute to the United States Army, not
only in their valiant and ruthless battle-worthy qualities, but also in
the skill of their commanders and the excellence of their supply
arrangements. When one remembers that the United States four or
five years ago was a peace-loving Power, without any great body of
troops or munitions, and with only a very small regular Army to
draw their commanders from, the American achievement is truly
amazing. After the intense training they have received for nearly
three years, or more than three years in some cases, their divisions are
now composed of regular professional soldiers whose military quality is out of all comparison with hurriedly-raised wartime levies.
These soldiers, like our own from Great Britain who have been even
longer under arms, are capable of being placed immediately on
landing in the battle line, and have proved themselves more than a
match for the so-called veteran troops of Germany, who, though
fighting desperately, are showing themselves decidedly the worse for
wear. When I think of the measureless output of ships, munitions
and supplies of all kinds with which the United States has equipped
herself and has sustained all the fighting Allies in generous measure,
and of the mighty war she is conducting, with troops of our
Australian and New Zealand Dominions, over the spaces of the
Pacific Ocean, this House may indeed salute our sister nation as
being at the highest pinnacle of her power and fame.
I am very glad to say that we also have been able to make a worthy
contribution. Some time ago, a statement was made by a Senator to
the effect that the American public would be shocked to learn that
they would have to provide 80 per cent of the forces to invade the
Continent. I then said tha~ at the outset of the invasion of France the
British and American Forces would be practically equal, but that
thereafter the American build-up would give them steadily the lead. I
am glad to say that after 120 days of fighting we still bear, in the
cross-Channel troops, a proportion of two to three in personnel and
of four to five-and-a-half in fighting divisions in France. Casualties
have followed very closely the proportions of the numbers. In fact,
these troops fight so level that the casualties almost exactly follow the
numbers engaged. We have, I regret to say, lost upwards of 90,000
men, killed, wounded and missing, and the United States, including
General Patch's Army, over 145,000. Such is the price in blood paid
by the English-speaking democracies for the actual liberation of the
soil of France. "
"'Democracy is no harlot', 8 December 1944, House of Commons",,"Democracy, I say, is not based on violence or terrorism, but on reason, on fair play, on freedom, on respecting other people's rights as well as their ambitions. Democracy is no harlot to be picked up in the street by a man with a tommy gun. I trust the people, the mass of the people, in almost any country, but I like to make sure that it is the people and not a gang of bandits from the mountains or from the countryside who think that by violer.ce they can overturn constituted authority, in some cases ancient Parliaments, Governments and States. That is my general description of the foundation upon which we should approach the various special instances on which I am going to dwell. During the war, of course, we have had to arm anyone who could shoot a Hun. Apart from their character, political convictions, past records and so forth, if they were out to shoot a Hun we accepted them as friends and tried to enable them to fulfil their healthy instincts. Mr McGovern (Glasgow, Shettleston): Now you are paying for it. Mr Churchill: We are paying for it in having this Debate today, which personally I have found rather enjoyable, so far. We are paying for it also with our treasure and our blood. We are not paying for it with our honour or by defeat. But when countries are liberated it does not follow that those who have received our weapons should use them in order to engross to themselves by violence and murder and bloodshed all those powers and traditions and continuity which many countries have slowly developed and to which quite a large
proportion of their people, I believe the great majority, are firmly
attached. If what is called in this Amendment the action of 'the
friends of democracy' is to be interpreted as carefully planned coups
d'etat by murder gangs and by the iron rule of ruffians seeking to
climb into the seats of power, without a vote ever having been cast in
their favour - if that is to masquerade as democracy I think the
House will unite in condemning it as a mockery."
"We demand unconditional surrender', 18 January 1945, House of Commons",,"I am clear that nothing should induce us to abandon the principle of unconditional surrender, or to enter into any form of negotiation with Germany or Japan, under whatever guise such suggestions may present themselves, until the act of unconditional surrender has been formally executed. But the President of the United States, and I in your name, have repeatedly declared that the enforcement of unconditional surrender upon the enemy in no way relieves the victorious Powers of their obligations to humanity, or of their duties as civilised and Christian nations. I read somewhere that when the ancient Athenians, on one occasion, overpowered a tribe in the Peloponnesus which had wrought them great injury by base, treacherous means, and when they had the hostile army herded on a beach naked for slaughter, they forgave them and set them free, and they said: This was not because they were men; it was done because of the nature of Man. Similarly, in this temper, we may now say to our foes, 'We demand unconditional surrender, but you well know how strict are the moral limits within which our action is confined. We are no extirpators of
nations, butchers of peoples. We make no bargain with you. We
accord you nothing as a right. Abandon your resistance unconditionally. We remain bound by our customs and our nature.'
There is another reason why any abrogation of the principle of
unconditional surrender would be most improvident at the present
time, and it is a reason by no means inconsistent with, or
contradictory to, that which I have just given. We should have to
discuss with the enemy, while they still remained with arms in their
hands, all the painful details of the settlement which their indescribable crimes have made necessary for the future safety of Europe and
of the world; and these, when recited in detail, might well become a
greater obstacle to the end of the struggle than the broad generalisation which the term 'unconditional surrender' implies.
The Germans know perfectly well how these matters stand in
general. Several countries have already surrendered unconditionally
to the victorious Allies, to Russia, to Britain and to the United States.
Already there is a tolerable life appointed for their peoples. Take
Finland, take Italy: these peoples have not all been massacred and
enslaved. On the contrary, so far as Italy is concerned, there are
moments when one has almost wondered whether it was they who
had unconditionally surrendered to us, or whether we were about to
surrender unconditionally to them. This, at least, I can say on behalf
of the United Nations to Germany: 'If you surrender now, nothing
that you will have to endure after the war will be comparable to
what you are otherwise going to suffer during the year 1945.'
Peace, though based on unconditional surrender, will bring to
Germany and Japan an immense, immediate amelioration of the
suffering and agony which now lie before them. We, the Allies, are
no monsters, but faithful men trying to carry forward the light of the
world, trying to raise, from the bloody welter and confusion in which
mankind is now plunged, ;'! structure of peace, of freedom, of justice
and of law, which system shall be an abiding and lasting shelter for
all. That is how I venture to set before the Committee today the grave
issue called 'unconditional surrender'. "
"'Greece forever!', 14 February 1945, Constitution Square, Athens",,"These are great days. These are days when dawn is bright, when darkness rolls away. A great future lies before your great country. There has been much misunderstanding and ignorance of our common cause in many parts of the world, and there have been misrepresentations of issues fought out here in Athens. But now these matters are clearing, and there is an understanding of the part Greece has played and will play' in the world. Speaking as an Englishman, I am very proud of the part which the British Army played in protecting this great and immortal city against violence and anarchy. Our two countries have for long marched together along hard dusty roads in friendship and in loyalty. Freedom and prosperity and happiness are dear to all nations of the British Commonwealth and Empire. We who have been associated with you in the very long struggle for Greek liberty, we will march with you till we reach the end of the dark valley, and we will march with you till we reach the broad highlands of justice and peace. Let no one fail in his duty towards his country. Let no one swerve off the high road of truth and honour. Let no one fail to rise to the occasion of this great moment and of these splendid days. Let the Greek Nation stand first in every heart. Let it stand first in every man and woman. Let the future of Greece shine brightly in their eyes. From the bottom of my heart I wish you prosperity. From the bottom of my heart I hope that Greece will take her proper place in the circle of victorious nations - of nations who have suffered terribly in war. Let right prevail. Let party hatreds die. Let there be unity, let there be resolute comradeship. Greece forever. Greece for all."
"The Yalta Conference, 27 February 1945, House of Commons",,"The recent Conference of the three Powers in the Crimea faced realities and difficulties in so exceptional a manner that the result constituted an act of State, on which Parliament should formally express their opinion. His Majesty's Government feel they have the right to know where they stand with the House of Commons. A strong expression of support by the House will strengthen our position among our Allies. The intimate and sensitive connections between the Executive Government and the House of Commons will thereby also be made plain, thus showing the liveliness of our democratic institutions, and the subordination of Ministers to Parliamentary authority. The House will not shrink from its duty of pronouncing. We live in a time when equality of decision is required from all who take part in our public affairs. In this way also, the firm and tenacious character of the present Parliament, and, generally, of our Parliamentary institutions, emerging as they do fortified from the storms of the war, will be made manifest. We have therefore thought it right and necessary to place a positive Motion on the Paper, in support of which I should like to submit some facts and arguments to the House at the opening of this three days' Debate. The difficulties of bringing about a Conference of the three heads of the Governments of the principal Allies are only too obvious. The fact that, in spite of all modern methods of communication, fourteen months elapsed between Teheran and Yalta is a measure of those
difficulties. It is well known that His Majesty's Government greatly
desired a triple meeting in the Autumn. We rejoiced when, at last,
Yalta was fixed. On the way there, the British and United States
delegations met at Malta to discuss the wide range of our joint
military and political affairs. The combined Chiefs of Staff of the two
countries were for three days in conference upon the great operations
now developing on the Western Front, and upon the war plans
against Japan, which it was appropriate for us to discuss together.
The Foreign Secretary, accompanied by high officials and assistants,
some of whom unhappily perished on the way, also met Mr
Stettinius there. On the morning of 2nd February the cruiser which
bore the President steamed majestically into the battle-scarred
harbour. A plenary meeting of the combined Chiefs of Staff was held
in the afternoon, at which the President and I approved the proposals
which had been so carefully worked out in the preceding days for
carrying our joint war effort to the highest pitch, and for the shaping
and timing of the military operations ....
After that, we all flew safely from Malta to the airfield in the
Crimea, and motored over the mountains - about which very
alarming accounts had been given, but these proved to be greatly
exaggerated - until we found shelter on the Southern shore of the
Crimea. This is protected by the mountains, and forms a beautiful
Black Sea Riviera, where there still remain un destroyed by the Nazis
a few villas and palaces of the vanished Imperial and aristocratic
regime. By extreme exertions and every form of thoughtfulness and
ingenuity, our Russian hosts had restored these dwellings to good
order, and had provided for our accommodation and comfort in the
true style of Russian hospitality. In the background were the
precipices and the mountains; beyond them, the devastated fields and
shattered dwellings of the Crimea, across which the armies have
twice surged in deadly combat. Here on this shore, we laboured for
nine days and grappled with many problems of war and policy while
friendship grew ....
On world organisation, there is little that I can say beyond what is
contained in the Report of the Conference, and, of course, in the
earlier reports which emanated from Dumbarton Oaks. In the
Crimea, the three Great Powers agreed on a solution of the difficult
question of voting procedure, to which no answer had been found at
Dumbarton Oaks. Agreement on this vital matter has enabled us to
take the next step forward in the setting-up of the new world
organisation, and the arrangements are in hand for the issue of invitations to the United Nations Conference which, as I have said,
will meet in a couple of months at San Francisco. I wish I could give
to the House full particulars of the solution of this question of the
voting procedure, to which representatives of the three Great Powers,
formerly in disagreement, have now wholeheartedly agreed. We
thought it right, however, that we should consult both France and
China, and should endeavour to secure their acceptance before the
formula was published. For the moment, therefore, I can only deal
with the matter in general terms.
Here is the difficulty which has to be faced. It is on the Great
Powers that the chief burden of maintaining peace and security will
fall. The new world organisation must take into account this special
responsibility of the Great Powers, and must be so framed as not to
compromise their unity, or their capacity for effective action if it is
called for at short notice. At the same time, the world organisation
cannot be based upon a dictatorship of the Great Powers. It is their
duty to serve the world and not to rule it. We trust the voting
procedure on which we agreed at Yalta meets these two essential
points, and provides a system which is fair and acceptable, having
regard to the evident difficulties, which will meet anyone who gives
prolonged thought to the subject ....
The Crimea Conference leaves the Allies more closely united than
ever before, both in the military and in the political sphere. Let
Germany recognise that it is futile to hope for division among the
Allies, and that nothing can avert her utter defeat. Further resistance
will only be the cause of needless suffering. The Allies are resolved
that Germany shall be totally disarmed, that Nazism and militarism
in Germany shall be destroyed, that war criminals shall be justly and
swiftly punished, that all German industry capable of military
production shall be eliminated or controlled, and that Germany shall
make compensation in kind to the utmost of her ability for damage
done to Allied nations. On the other hand, it is not the purpose of the
Allies to destroy the people of Germany, or leave them without the
necessary means of subsistence. Our policy is not revenge; it is to take
such measures as may be necessary to secure the future peace and
safety of the world. There will be a place one day for Germans in the
comity of nations, but only when all traces of Nazism and militarism
have been effectively and finally extirpated ....
I now come to the most difficult and agitating part of the
statement which I have to make to the House - the question of
Poland. For more than a year past, and since the tide of war has
turned so strongly against Germany, the Polish problem has been divided into two main Issues - the frontiers of Poland and the
freedom of Poland.
The House is well aware from the speeches I have made to them
that the freedom, independence, integrity and sovereignty of Poland
have always seemed to His Majesty's Government more important
than the actual frontiers. To establish a free Polish nation with a
good home to live in has always far outweighed, in my mind, the
actual tracing of the frontier line, or whether these boundaries should
be shifted on both sides of Poland farther to the West ....
But even more important than the frontiers of Poland, within the
limits now disclosed, is the freedom of Poland. The home of the Poles
is settled. Are they to be masters in their own house? Are they to be
free, as we in Britain and the United States or France are free? Is their
sovereignty and their ir..dependence to be untrammelled, or are they
to become a mere projection of the Soviet State, forced against their
will, by an armed minority, to adopt a Communist or totalitarian
system? Well, I am putting the case in all its bluntness. It is a
touchstone far more sellsitive and vital than the drawing of frontier
lines. Where does Poland stand? Where do we all stand on this?
Most solemn declarations have been made by Marshal Stalin and
the Soviet Union that the sovereign independence of Poland is to be
maintained, and this decision is now joined in both by Great Britain
and the United States. Here also, the world organisation will in due
course assume a measure of responsibility. The Poles will have their
future in their own hands, with the single limitation that they must
honestly follow, in harmony with their Allies, a policy friendly to
Russia. That is surely reasonable.
The procedure which the three Great Powers have unitedly
adopted to achieve this vital aim is set forth in unmistakable terms in
the Crimea declaration. The agreement provides for consultations,
with a view to the establishment in Poland of a new Polish
Provisional Government of National Unity, with which the three
major Powers can all enter into diplomatic relations, instead of some
recognising one Polish Government and the rest another, a situation
which, if it had survived the Yalta Conference, would have
proclaimed to the world disunity and confusion. We had to settle it,
and we settled it there. No binding restrictions have been imposed
upon the scope and method of those consultations. His Majesty's
Government intend to do all in their power to ensure that they shall
be as wide as possible, and that representative Poles of all democratic
parties are given full freedom to come and make their views known.
Arrangements for this are now being made in Moscow by the Commission of three, comprising M. Molotov, and Mr Harriman
and Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, representing the United States and
Great Britain respectively. It will be for the Poles themselves, with
such assistance as the Allies are able to give them, to agree upon the
composition and constitution of the new Polish Government of
National Unity. Thereafter, His Majesty's Government, through
their representative in Poland, will use all their influence to ensure
that the free elections to which the new Polish Government will be
pledged shall be fairly carried. out under all proper democratic
safeguards.
Our two guiding principles in dealing with all these problems of
the Continent and of liberated countries, have been clear: While the
war is on, we give help to anyone who can kill a Hun; when the war
is over, we look to the solution of a free, unfettered, democratic
election. Those are the two principles which this Coalition Government have applied, to the best of their ability, to the circumstances
and situations in this entangled and infinitely varied development ....
The House should read carefully again and again - those Members
who have doubts - the words and the terms of the Declaration, every
word of which was the subject of the most profound and searching
attention by the Heads of the three Governments, and by the Foreign
Secretaries and all their experts. How will this Declaration be carried
out? How will phrases like 'Free and unfettered elections on the basis
of universal suffrage and secret ballot' be interpreted? Will the 'new'
Government be 'properly' constituted, with a fair representation of
the Polish people, as far as can be made practicable at the moment,
and as soon as possible? Will the elections be free and unfettered?
Will the candidates of all democratic parties be able to present
themselves to the electors, and to conduct their campaigns? What are
democratic parties? People always take different views. Even in our
own country there has been from time to time an effort by one party
or the other to claim that they are the true democratic party, and the
rest are either Bolsheviks or Tory landlords. What are democratic
parties? Obviously, this is capable of being settled. Will the election
be what we should say was fair and free in this country, making
some allowance for the great confusion and disorder which prevails?
There are a great number of parties in Poland. We have agreed that
all those that are democratic parties - not Nazi or Fascist parties or
parties of collaborators with the enemy - all these will be able to take
their part.
These are questions upon which we have the clearest views, in accordance with the principles of the Declaration on liberated
Europe, to which all three Governments have duly subscribed. It is
on that basis that the Moscow Commission of three was intended to
work, and on that basis it has already begun to work.
The impression I brought back from the Crimea, and from all my
other contacts, is that Marshal Stalin and the Soviet leaders wish to
live in honourable friendship and equality with the Western
democracies. I feel also that their word is their bond. I know of no
Government which stands to its obligations, even in its own despite,
more solidly than the Russian Soviet Government. I decline absolutely to embark here on a discussion about Russian good faith. It is
quite evident that these matters touch the whole future of the world.
Sombre indeed would be the fortunes of mankind if some awful
schism arose between the Western democracies and the Russian
Soviet Union, if the future world organisation were rent asunder, and
if new cataclysms of inconceivable violence destroyed all that is left
of the treasures and liberties of mankind. "
"Lloyd George, 28 March 1945, House of Commons",,"Shortly after David Lloyd George first took Cabinet office as President of the Board of Trade, the Liberals, who had been in eclipse for twenty years, obtained in January, 1906, an overwhelming majority over all other parties. They were independent of the Irish; the Labour Party was in its infancy; the Conservatives were reduced to little more than 100. But this moment of political triumph occurred in a period when the aspirations of 19th-century Liberalism had been largely achieved. Most of the great movements and principles of Liberalism had become the common property of enlightened men all over the civilised world. The chains had been struck from the slave; a free career was open to talent; the extension of the franchise was moving irresistibly forward; the advance in education was rapid and continuous, not only in this Island but in
many lands. Thus at the moment when the Liberal Party became
supreme, the great and beneficent impulses which had urged them
forward were largely assuaged by success. Some new and potent
conception had to be found by those who were called into power.
It was Lloyd George who launched the Liberal and Radical forces
of this country effectively into the broad stream of social betterment
and social security along which all modern parties now steer. There
was no man so gifted, so eloquent, so forceful, who knew the life of
the people so well. His warm heart was stirred by the many perils
which beset the cottage homes: the health of the breadwinner, the
fate of his widow, the nourishment and upbringing of his children,
the meagre and haphazard provision of medical treatment and
sanatoria, and the lack of any organised accessible medical service of
a kind worthy of the age, from which the mass of the wage earners
and the poor suffered. All this excited his wrath. Pity and
compassion lent their powerful wings. He knew the terror with
which old age threater:ed the toiler - that after a life of exertion he
could be no more than a burden at the fireside and in the family of a
struggling son. When I first became Lloyd George's friend and active
associate, now more than forty years ago, this deep love of the
people, the profound knowledge of their lives and of the undue and
needless pressures under which they lived, impressed itself indelibly
upon my mind.
Then there was his dauntless courage, his untiring energy, his
oratory, persuasive, provocative, now grave, now gay. His swift,
penetrating, comprehensive mind was always grasping at the root, or
what he thought to be the root, of every question. His eye ranged
ahead of the obvious. He was always hunting in the field beyond. I
have often heard people come to him with a plan, and he would say
'That is all right, but what happens when we get over the bridge?
What do we do then?'
In his prime, his power, his influence, his initiative, were
unequalled in the land. He was the champion of the weak and the
poor. Those were great days. Nearly two generations have passed.
Most people are unconscious of how much their lives have been
shaped by the laws for which Lloyd George was responsible. Health
Insurance and Old Age Pensions were the first large-scale Stateconscious efforts to set a balustrade along the crowded causeway of
the people's life, and, without pulling down the structures of society,
to fasten a lid over the abyss into which vast numbers used to fall,
generation after generation, uncared-for and indeed unnoticed. Now we move forward confidently into larger and more far-reaching
applications of these ideas. I was his lieutenant in those bygone days,
and shared in a minor way in the work. I have lived to see long
strides taken, and being taken, and going to be taken, on this path of
insurance by which the vultures of utter ruin are driven from the
dwellings of the nation. The stamps we lick, the roads we travel, the
system of progressive taxation, the principal remedies that have so
far been used against unemployment - all these to a very great extent
were part not only of the mission but of the actual achievement of
Lloyd George; and I am sure that as time passes his name will not
only live but shine on account of the great, laborious, constructive
work he did for the social and domestic life of our country.
When the calm, complacent, self-satisfied tranquillities of the
Victorian era had exploded into the world convulsions and wars of
the terrible twentieth century, Lloyd George had another part to
play, on which his fame will stand with equal or even greater
firmness. Although unacquainted with the military arts, although by
public repute a pugnacioli5 pacifist, when the life of our country was
in peril he rallied to the war effort and cast aside all other thoughts
and aims. He was the first to discern the fearful shortages of
ammunition and artillery and all the other appliances of war which
would so soon affect, and in the case of Imperial Russia mortally
affect, the warring nations on both sides ....
Lloyd George left the Exchequer, when the Coalition Government
was formed, for the Ministry of Munitions. Here he hurled himself
into the mobilisation of British industry. In 1915 he was building
great war factories that could not come into operation for two years.
There was the usual talk about the war being over in a few months,
but he did not hesitate to plan on a vast scale for two years ahead. It
was my fortune to inherit the output of those factories in 1917 - the
vast, overflowing output which came from them. Presently Lloyd
George seized the main power in the State and the leadership of the
Government. [Han. Members: 'Seized?'] Seized. I think it was Carlyle
who said of Oliver Cromwell:
He coveted the place; perhaps the place was his.
He imparted immediately a new surge of strength, of impulse, far
stronger than anything that had been known up to that time, and
extending over the whole field of wartime Government, every part of
which was of equal interest to him.
I have already written about him at this time, when I watched him so closely and enjoyed his confidence and admired him so much, and
I have recorded two characteristics of his which seemed to me
invaluable in those days: first, his power to live in the present yet
without taking short views; and secondly, his power of drawing from
misfortune itself the means of future success. All this was illustrated
by the successful development of the war; by the adoption of the
convoy system, which he enforced upon the Admiralty and by which
the U-boats were defeated; by the unified command on the Western
Front which gave Marshal Foch the power to lead us all to victory;
and in many other matters which form a part of the story of those
sombre and tremendous years, the memory of which for ever abides
with me, and to which I have often recurred in thought during our
present second heavy struggle against German aggression, now
drawing towards its victorious close.
Thus the statesman and guide whose gentle passing in the fullness
of his years we mourn today served our country, our Island and our
age, both faithfully and well in peace and in war. His long life was,
from almost the beginIling to almost the end, spent in political strife
and controversy. He aroused intense and sometimes needless antagonisms. He had fierce and bitter quarrels at various times with all the
parties. He faced undismayed the storms of criticism and hostility. In
spite of all obstacles, including those he raised himself, he achieved
his main purposes. As ;l man of action, resource and creative energy
he stood, when at his zenith, without a rival. His name is a
household word throughout our Commonwealth of Nations. He was
the greatest Welshman which that unconquerable race has produced
since the age of the Tudors. Much of his work abides, some of it will
grow greatly in the future, and those who come after us will find the
pillars of his life's toil upstanding, massive and indestructible; and we
ourselves, gathered here today, may indeed be thankful that he
voyaged with us through storm and tumult with so much help and
guidance to bestow. "
"President Roosevelt, 17 April 1945, House of Commons",,"I beg to move: That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty to convey to His Majesty the deep sorrow with which this House has learned of the death of the President of the United States of America, and to pray His Majesty that in communicating his own sentiments of grief to the United States Government, he will also be generously pleased to express on the part of this House their sense of the loss which the British Commonwealth and Empire and the cause of the Allied nations have sustained, and their profound sympathy with Mrs Roosevelt and the late President's family, and with the Government and people of the United States of America. My friendship with the great man to whose work and fame we pay our tribute today began and ripened during this war. I had met him, but only for a few minutes, after the close of the last war, and as soon as I went to the Admiralty in September 1939, he telegraphed inviting me to correspond with him direct on naval or other matters if at any time I felt inclined. Having obtained the permission of the Prime Minister, I did so. Knowing President Roosevelt's keen interest in sea warfare, I furnished him with a stream of information about our naval affairs, and about the various actions, including especially the action of the Plate River, which lighted the first gloomy winter of the war. When I became Prime Minister, and the war broke out in all its hideous fury, when our own life and survival hung in the balance, I was already in a position to telegraph to the President on terms of an association which had become most intimate and, to me, most agreeable. This continued through all the ups and downs of the world struggle until Thursday last, when I received my last messages from him. These messages showed no falling off in his accustomed
clear vision and vigour upon perplexing and complicated matters. I
may mention that this correspondence which, of course, was greatly
increased after the United States's entry into the war, comprises to
and fro between us, over 1,700 messages. Many of these were
lengthy messages, and the majority dealt with those more difficult
points which come to be discussed upon the level of heads of
Governments only after official solutions have not been reached at
other stages. To this correspondence there must be added our nine
meetings - at Argentia, three in Washington, at Casablanca, at
Teheran, two at Quebec and, last of all, at Yalta, comprising in all
about 120 days of close personal contact, during a great part of which
I stayed with him at the White House or at his home at Hyde Park or
in his retreat in the Blue Mountains, which he called Shangri-la.
I conceived an admiration for him as a statesman, a man of affairs,
and a war leader. I felt the utmost confidence in his upright, inspiring
character and outlook, and a personal regard - affection I must sayfor him beyond my power to express today. His love of his own
country, his respect for its constitution, his power of gauging the
tides and currents of its mobile public opinion, were always evident,
but added to these were the beatings of that generous heart which
was always stirred to anger and to action by spectacles of aggression
and oppression by the strong against the weak. It is, indeed, a loss, a
bitter loss to humanity that those heart-beats are stilled for ever.
President Roosevelt's physical affliction lay heavily upon him. It
was a marvel that he bore up against it through all the many years of
tumult and storm. Not one man in ten millions, stricken and crippled
as he was, would have attempted to plunge into a life of physical and
mental exertion and of hard, ceaseless political controversy. Not one
in ten millions would have tried, not one in a generation would have
succeeded, not only in entering this sphere, not only in acting
vehemently in it, but in becoming indisputable master of the scene. In
this extraordinary effort of the spirit over the flesh, of will-power
over physical infirmity, he was inspired and sustained by that noble
woman, his devoted wife, whose high ideals marched with his own,
and to whom the deep and respectful sympathy of the House of
Commons flows out today in all fullness.
There is no doubt that the President foresaw the great dangers
closing in upon the pre-war world with far more prescience than
most well-informed people on either side of the Atlantic, and that he
urged forward with all his power such precautionary military
preparations as peacetime opinion in the United States could be brought to accept. There never was a moment's doubt, as the quarrel
opened, upon which side his sympathies lay. The fall of France, and
what seemed to most people outside this island, the impending
destruction of Great Bntain, were to him an agony, although he
never lost faith in us. They were an agony to him not only on
account of Europe, but because of the serious perils to which the
United States herself would have been exposed had we been
overwhelmed or the survivors cast down under the German yoke.
The bearing of the British nation at that time of stress, when we were
all alone, filled him and vast numbers of his countrymen with the
warmest sentiments towards our people. He and they felt the blitz of
the stern winter of 1940-41, when Hitler set himself to rub out the
cities of our country, as much as any of us did, and perhaps more
indeed, for imagination is often more torturing than reality. There is
no doubt that the bearing of the British and, above all, of the
Londoners, kindled fires in American bosoms far harder to quench
than the conflagrations from which we were suffering. There was
also at that time, in spite of General Wavell's victories - all the more,
indeed, because of the reinforcements which were sent from this
country to him - the apprehension widespread in the United States
that we should be invaded by Germany after the fullest preparation
in the spring of 1941. It was in February that the President sent to
England the late Mr Wendell Willkie, who, although a political rival
and an opposing candidate, felt as he did on many important points.
Mr Willkie brought a letter from Mr Roosevelt, which the President
had written in his own hand, and this letter contained the famous
lines of Longfellow:
... Sail on, 0 ship of State!
Sail on, 0 Union, strong and great!
Humanity with all its fears,
With all the hopes of future years,
Is hanging breathless on thy fate!
At about that same time he devised the extraordinary measure of
assistance called Lend-Lease, which will stand forth as the most
unselfish and un sordid financial act of any country in all history. The
effect of this was greatly to increase British fighting power, and for
all the purpose of the war effort to make us, as it were, a much more
numerous community. In that autumn I met the President for the first
time during the war at Argentia in Newfoundland, and together we
drew up the declaration which has since been called the Atlantic Charter, and which will, I trust, long remain a guide for both our
peoples and for other people of the world.
All this time in deep and dark and deadly secrecy, the Japanese
were preparing their act of treachery and greed. When next we met in
Washington, Japan, Germany and Italy had declared war upon the
United States, and both our countries were in arms, shoulder to
shoulder. Since then we have advanced over the land and over the sea
through many difficulties and disappointments, but always with a
broadening measure of success. I need not dwell upon the series of
great operations which have taken place in the Western Hemisphere,
to say nothing of that other immense war proceeding on the other
side of the world. Nor need I speak of the plans which we made with
our great ally, Russia, at Teheran, for these have now been carried
out for all the world to see.
But at Yalta I noticed that the President was ailing. His captivating
smile, his gay and charming manner, had not deserted him, but his
face had a transparency, an air of purification, and often there was a
faraway look in his eyes. When I took my leave of him in Alexandria
harbour I must confess that I had an indefinable sense of fear that his
health and his strength were on the ebb. But nothing altered his
inflexible sense of duty. To the end he faced his innumerable tasks
unflinching. One of the tasks of the President is to sign maybe a
hundred or two State papers with his own hand every day,
commissions and so forth. All this he continued to carry out with the
utmost strictness. When death came suddenly upon him 'he had
finished his mail'. That portion of hIS day's work was done. As the
saying goes, he died in harness, and we may well say in battle
harness, like his soldiers, sailors, and airmen, who side by side with
ours are carrying on their task to the end all over the world. What an
enviable death was his! He had brought his country through the
worst of its perils and the heaviest of its toils. Victory had cast its
sure and steady beam upon him.
In the days of peace he had broadened and stabilised the
foundations of American life and union. In war he had raised the
strength, might and glory of the great Republic to a height never
attained by any nation in history. With her left hand she was leading
the advance of the conquering Allied armies into the heart of
Germany, and with her right, on the other side of the globe, she was
irresistibly and swiftly breaking up the power of Japan. And all the
time ships, munitions, supplies, and food of every kind were aiding
on a gigantic scale her allies, great and small, in the course of the
long struggle. But all this was no more than worldly power and grandeur, had it
not been that the causes of human freedom and of social justice, to
which so much of his life had been given, added a lustre to this power
and pomp and warlike might, a lustre which will long be discernible
among men. He has left behind him a band of resolute and able men
handling the numerous interrelated parts of the vast American war
machine. He has left a successor who comes forward with firm step
and sure conviction to carryon the task to its appointed end. For us,
it remains only to say that in Franklin Roosevelt there died the
greatest American friend we have ever known, and the greatest
champion of freedom who has ever brought help and comfort from
the new world to the old. "
"'No words can ever express the horror', 19 April 1945, House of Commons",,"No words can express the horror which is felt by His Majesty's
Government and their principal Allies at the proofs of these frightful
crimes now daily coming into view. I do not at present, however,
wish to commit myself to any special policy such as the suggestion
made by my hon. Friend (to retain the captured concentration camp
of Buchenwald intact as a memorial of German methods].
I have this morning received an informal message from General
Eisenhower saying that the new discoveries, particularly at Weimar,
far surpass anything previously exposed. He invites me to send a
body of Members of Parliament at once to his Headquarters in order
that they may themselves have ocular and first-hand proof of these
atrocities.
The matter is of urgency, as of course it is not possible to arrest the
processes of decay in many cases. In view of this urgency, I have
come to the conclusion that eight Members of this House and two
Members of the House of Lords should form a Parliamentary Delegation, and should travel out at once to the Supreme Headquarters, where General Eisenhower will make all the necessary
arrangements for their inspection of the scenes, whether in American
or British sectors. Members who volunteer for this extremely
unpleasant but none the less necessary duty, should give their names
to their Party Whips, in order that a body representative of all Parties
may be selected by the usual methods during this afternoon. I should
propose that they start tomorrow.
I hope that the House will approve of the somewhat rapid decision
I have taken. "
"Victory in Europe, 8 May 1945, House of Commons and Broadcast, London",,"Yesterday morning at 2.41 a.m. at Headquarters, General JodI, the representative of the German High Command, and Grand Admiral Doenitz, the designated head of the German State, signed the act of unconditional surrender of all German land, sea, and air forces in Europe to the Allied Expeditionary Force, and simultaneously to the Soviet High Command. General Bedell Smith, Chief of Staff of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and General Fran~ois Sevez signed the document on behalf of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and General Susloparov signed on behalf of the Russian High Command. Tod~y this agreement will be ratified and confirmed at Berlin, where Air Chief Marshal Tedder, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and General de Lattre de Tassigny will sign on behalf of General Eisenhower. Marshal Zhukov will sign on behalf of the Soviet High Command. The German representatives will be Field-Marshal Keitel, Chief of the High Command, and the Commanders-in-Chief of the German Army, Navy, and Air Forces. Hostilities will end officially at one minute after midnight tonight
(Tuesday, May 8), but in the interests of saving lives the 'Cease fire'
began yesterday to be sounded all along the front, and our dear
Channel Islands are also to be freed today.
The Germans are still in places resisting the Russian troops, but
should they continue to do so after midnight they will, of course,
deprive themselves of the protection of the laws of war, and will be
attacked from all quarters by the Allied troops. It is not surprising
that on such long fronts and in the existing disorder of the enemy the
orders of the German High Command should not in every case be
obeyed immediately. This does not, in our opinion, with the best
military advice at our disposal, constitute any reason for withholding
from the nation the facts communicated to us by General Eisenhower
of the unconditional surrender already signed at Rheims, nor should
it prevent us from celebrating today and tomorrow (Wednesday) as
Victory in Europe days.
Today, perhaps, we shall think mostly of ourselves. Tomorrow we
shall pay a particul;:lr tribute to our Russian comrades, whose
prowess in the field has been one of the grand contributions to the
general victory.
The German war is therefore at an end. After years of intense
preparation, Germany hurled herself on Poland at the beginning of
September, 1939; and, in pursuance of our guarantee to Poland and
in agreement with the French Republic, Great Britain, the British
Empire and Commonwealth of Nations, declared war upon this foul
aggression. After gallant France had been struck down we, from this
Island and from our united Empire, maintained the struggle singlehanded for a whole year until we were joined by the military might
of Soviet Russia, and later by the overwhelming power and resources
of the United States of America.
Finally almost the whole world was combined against the evildoers, who are now prostrate before us. Our gratitude to our
splendid Allies goes forth from all our hearts in this Island and
throughout the British Empire.
We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing; but let us not
forget for a moment the toil and efforts that lie ahead. Japan, with all
her treachery and greed, remains unsubdued. The injury she has
inflicted on Great Britain, the United States, and other countries, and
her detestable cruelties, call for justice and retribution. We must now
devote all our strength and resources to the completion of our task,
both at home and abroad. Advance, Britannia! Long live the cause of
freedom! God save the King! ... That is the message which I have been instructed to deliver to the
British Nation and Commonwealth. I have only two or three
sentences to add. They will convey to the House my deep gratitude to
this House of Commons, which has proved itself the strongest
foundation for waging war that has ever been seen in the whole of
our long history. We have all of us made our mistakes, but the
strength of the Parliamentary institution has been shown to enable it
at the same moment to preserved all the title-deeds of democracy
while waging war in the most stern and protracted form. I wish to
give my hearty thanks to men of all Parties, to everyone in every part
of the House where they sit, for the way in which the liveliness of
Parliamentary institutions has been maintained under the fire of the
enemy, and for the way in which we have been able to persevere -
and we could have persevered much longer if need had been - till all
the objectives which we set before us for the procuring of the
unlimited and unconditional surrender of the enemy had been
achieved. I recollect well at the end of the last war, more than a
quarter of a century aro, that the House, when it heard the long list
of the surrender terms, the armistice terms, which had been imposed
upon the Germans, did not feel inclined for debate or business, but
desired to offer thanks to Almighty God, to the Great Power which
seems to shape and design the fortunes of nations and the destiny of
man; and I therefore beg, Sir, with your permission to move:
That this House do now attend to the Church of St Margaret,
Westminster, to give hUalble and reverent thanks to Almighty God for
our deliverance from the threat of German domination.
This is the identical Motion which was moved in former times. "
"'This is your victory', 8 May 1945, Ministry of Health, London",,"God bless you all. This is your victory! It is the victory of the cause of freedom in every land. In all our long history we have never seen a greater day than this. Everyone, man or woman, has done their best. Everyone has tried. Neither the long years, nor the dangers, nor the fierce attacks of the enemy, have in any way weakened the independent resolve of the British nation .... My dear friends, this is your hour. This is not victory of a party or of any class. It's a victory of the great British nation as a whole. We were the first, in this ancient island, to draw the sword against tyranny. After a while we were left all alone against the most tremendous military power that has been seen. We were all alone for a whole year. There we stood, alone. Did anyone want to give in? [The crowd shouted 'No.'] Were we down-hearted? ['No!'] The lights went out and the bombs came down. But every man, woman and child in the country had no thought of quitting the struggle. London can take it. So we came back after long months from the jaws of death, out of the mouth of hell, while all the world wondered. When shall the reputation and faith of this generation of English men and women fail? I say that in the long years to come not only will the people of this island but of the world, whenever the bird of freedom chirps in human hearts, look back to what we've done and they will say 'do not despair, do not yield to violence and tyranny, march straight forward and die if need be - unconquered.' Now we have emerged from one deadly struggle - a terrible foe has been cast on the ground and awaits our judgment and our mercy. But there is another foe who occupies large portions of the British Empire, a foe stained with cruelty and greed - the Japanese. I rejoice we can all take a night off today and another day tomorrow. Tomorrow our great Russian allies will also be celebrating victory and after that we must begin the task of rebuilding our health and homes, doing our utmost to make this country a land in which all have a chance, in which all have a duty, and we must turn ourselves to fulfil our duty to our own countrymen, and to our gallant allies of the United States who were so foully and treacherously attacked by Japan. We will go band in hand with them. Even if it is a hard struggle we will not be the ones who will fail."
"Forward; till the whole task is done', 13 May 1945, Broadcast, London",,"It was five years ago on Thursday last that His Majesty the King
commissioned me to form a National Government of all parties to
carryon our affairs. Five years is a long time in human life, especially
when there is no remission for good conduct. However, this National
Government was sustained by Parliament and by the entire British
nation at home and by all our fighting men abroad, and by the
unswerving co-operation of the Dominions far across the oceans and
of our Empire in every quarter of the globe. After various episodes
had occurred it became clear last week that so far things have
worked out pretty well, and that the British Commonwealth and
Empire stands more united and more effectively powerful than at any
time in its long romantic hIstory. Certainly we are - this is what may
well, I think, be admitted by any fair-minded person - in a far better
state to cope with the problems and perils of the future than we were
five years ago ....
You have no doubt noticed in your reading of British history - and
I hope you will take pains to read it, for it is only from the past that
one can judge the future, and it is only from reading the story of the
British nation, of the British Empire, that you can feel a wellgrounded sense of pride to dwell in these islands - you have
sometimes noticed in your reading of British history that we have
had to hold out from time to time all alone, or to be the mainspring
of coalitions, against a Continental tyrant or dictator, and we have
had to hold out for quite a long time: against the Spanish Armada,
against the might of Louis XIV, when we led Europe for nearly
twenty-five years under William III and Marlborough, and a hundred
and fifty years ago, when Nelson, Pitt and Wellington broke
Napoleon, not without assistance from the heroic Russians of 1812.
In all these world wars our Island kept the lead of Europe or else held
out alone.
And if you hold out alone long enough, there always comes a time when the tyrant makes some ghastly mistake which alters the whole
balance of the struggle. On June 22, 1941, Hitler, master as he
thought himself of all Europe - nay, indeed, soon to be master of the
world, so he thought - treacherously, without warning, without the
slightest provocation, hurled himself on Russia and came face to face
with Marshal Stalin and the numberless millions of the Russian
people. And then at the end of the year Japan struck a felon blow at
the United States at Pearl Harbor, and at the same time attacked us in
Malaya and Singapore. Thereupon Hitler and Mussolini declared
war on the Republic of the United States.
Years have passed since then. Indeed every year seems to me
almost a decade. But never since the United States entered the war
have I had the slightest doubt but that we should be saved, and that
we only had to do our duty in order to win. We have played our part
in all this process by which the evil-doers have been overthrown, and
I hope I do not speak vain or boastful words, but from Alamein in
October, 1942, through the Anglo-American invasion of North
Africa, of Sicily, of Italy, with the capture of Rome, we marched
many miles and never knew defeat. And then last year, after two
years' patient preparation and marvellous devices of amphibious
warfare - and mark you, our scientists are not surpassed in any
nation in the world, especially when their thought is applied to naval
matters -last year on June 6 we seized a carefully-selected little toe of
German-occupied France and poured millions in from this Island and
from across the Atlantic, until the Seine, the Somme, and the Rhine
all fell behind the advancing Anglo-American spearheads. France
was liberated. She produced a fine army of gallant men to aid her
own liberation. Germany lay open.
Now from the other side the mighty military achievements of the
Russian people, always holding many more German troops on their
front than we could do, rolled forward to meet us in the heart and
centre of Germany. At the same time, in Italy, Field Marshal
Alexander's army of so many nations, the largest part of which was
British or British Empire, struck their final blow and compelled more
than a million enemy troops to surrender. This Fifteenth Army
Group, as we call it, British and Americans joined together in almost
equal numbers, are now deep in Austria, joining their right hand
with the Russians and their left with the United States armies of
General Eisenhower's command. It happened, as you may remember
- but memories are short - that in the space of three days we received
the news of the unlamented departures of Mussolini and Hitler, and
in three days also surrenders were made to Field Marshal Alexander and Field Marshal Montgomery of over two million five hundred
thousand soldiers of this terrible warlike German army.
I shall make it clear at this moment that we never failed to
recognise the immense superiority of the power used by the United
States in the rescue of France and the defeat of Germany. For our
part, British and Canadians, we have had about one-third as many
men over there as the Americans, but we have taken our full share of
the fighting, as the scale of our losses shows. Our Navy has borne
incomparably the heaviest burden in the Atlantic Ocean, in the
narrow seas and the Arctic convoys to Russia, while the United States
Navy has had to use its immense strength mainly against Japan. We
made a fair division of the labour, and we can each report that our
work is either done or going to be done. It is right and natural that
we should extol the virtues and glorious services of our own most
famous commanders, Alexander and Montgomery, neither of whom
was ever defeated since they began together at Alamein. Both of them
have conducted in Africa, in Italy, in Normandy and in Germany,
battles of the first magnitude :md of decisive consequence. At the
same time we know how great is our debt to the combining and
unifying command and high strategic direction of General Eisenhower ....
I wish I could tell you tonight that all our toils and troubles were
over. Then indeed I could end my five years' service happily, and if
you thought that you had had enough of me and that I ought to be
put out to grass, I tell you I would take it with the best of grace. But,
on the contrary, I must warn you, as I did when I began this five
years' task - and no one knew then that it would last so long - that
there is still a lot to do, and that you must be prepared for further
efforts of mind and body and further sacrifices to great causes if you
are not to fall back into the rut of inertia, the confusion of aim, and
the craven fear of being great. You must not weaken in any way in
your alert and vigilant frame of mind. Though holiday rejoicing is
necessary to the human spirit, yet it must add to the strength and
resilience with which every man and woman turns again to the work
they have to do, and also to the outlook and watch they have to keep
on public affairs.
On the Continent of Europe we have yet to make sure that the
simple and honourable purposes for which we entered the war are
not brushed aside or overlooked in the months following our success,
and that the words 'freedom', 'democracy', and 'liberation' are not
distorted from their true meaning as we have understood them.
There would be little use in punishing the Hitlerites for their crimes if law and justice did not rule, and if totalitarian or police governments
were to take the place of the German invaders. We seek nothing for
ourselves. But we must make sure that those causes which we fought
for find recognition at the peace table in facts as well as words, and
above all we must labour that the world organisation which the
United Nations are creating at San Francisco does not become an idle
name, does not become a shield for the strong and a mockery for the
weak. It is the victors who must search their hearts in their glowing
hours, and be worthy by their nobility of the immense forces that
they wield.
We must never forget that beyond all lurks Japan, harassed and
failing but still a people of a hundred millions, for whose warriors
death has few terrors. I cannot tell you tonight how much time or
what exertions will be required to compel the Japanese to make
amends for their odious treachery and cruelty. We - like China, so
long undaunted - have received horrible injuries from them ourselves, and we are bound by the ties of honour and fraternal loyalty
to the United States to fight this great war at the other end of the
world at their side without flagging or failing. We must remember
that Australia and New Zealand and Canada were and are all
directly menaced by this evil Power. They came to our aid in our
dark times, and we must not leave unfinished any task which
concerns their safety and their future. I told you hard things at the
beginning of these last five years; you did not shrink, and I should be
unworthy of your confidence and generosity if I did not still cry:
Forward, unflinching, unswerving, indomitable, till the whole task is
done and the whole world is safe and clean. "
"Back to party politics, 4 June 1945, Broadcast, London",,"I am sorry to have lost so many good friends who served with me in the five years' Coalition. It was impossible to go on in a state of 'electionitis' all through the summer and autumn. This election will last quite long enough for all who are concerned in it, and I expect many of the general public will be sick and tired of it before we get to polling day. My sincere hope was that we could have held together until the war against Japan was finished. On the other hand, there was a high duty to consult the people after all these years. I could only be relieved of that duty by the full agreement of the three parties, further fortified, perhaps, by a kind of official Gallup Poll, which I am sure would have resulted in an overwhelming request that we should go on to the end and finish the job. That would have enabled me to say at once, 'There will be no election for a year', or words to that effect. I know that many of my Labour colleagues would have been glad to carryon. On the other hand, the Socialist Party as a whole had been for some time eager to set out upon the political warpath, and when large numbers of people feel like that it is not good for their health to deny them the fight they want. We will therefore give it to them to the best of our ability. Party, my friends, has always played a great part in our affairs. Party ties have been considered honourable bonds, and no one could doubt that when the German war was over and the immediate danger to this country, which had led to the Coalition, had ceased, conflicting loyalties would arise. Our Socialist and Liberal friends felt themselves forced, therefore, to put party before country. They have departed, and we have been left to carry the nation's burden .... My friends, I must tell you that a Socialist policy is abhorrent to the British ideas of freedom. Although it is now put forward in the main by people who have a good grounding in the Liberalism and Radicalism of the early part of this century, there can be no doubt that Socialism is inseparably interwoven with Totalitarianism and the abject worship of the State. It is not alone that property, in all its forms, is struck at, but that liberty, in all its forms, is challenged by the fundamental conceptions of Socialism. Look how even today they hunger for controls of every kind, as if these were delectable foods instead of wartime inflictions and monstrosities. There is to be one State to which all are to be obedient
in every act of their lives. This State is to be the arch-employer, the
arch-planner, the arch-administrator and ruler, and the arch-caucusboss.
How is an ordinary citizen or subject of the King to stand up
against this formidable machine, which, once it is in power, will
prescribe for everyone of them where they are to work; what they
are to work at; where they may go and what they may say; what
views they are to hold and within what limits they may express them;
where their wives are to go to queue up for the State ration; and
what education their children are to receive to mould their views of
human liberty and conduct in the future?
A Socialist State once thoroughly completed in all its details and its
aspects - and that is what I am speaking of - could not afford to
suffer opposition. Here in old England, in Great Britain, of which old
England forms no inconspicuous part, in this glorious Island, the
cradle and citadel of free democracy throughout the world, we do
not like to be regimeated and ordered about and have every action of
our lives prescribed for us. In fact we punish criminals by sending
them to Wormwood Scrubs and Dartmoor, where they get full
employment, and whatever board and lodging is appointed by the
Home Secretary.
Socialism is, in its essence, an attack not only upon British
enterprise, but upon the right of the ordinary man or woman to
breathe freely without having a harsh, clumsy, tyrannical hand
clapped across their mouths and nostrils. A Free Parliament - look at
that - a Free Parliament is odious to the Socialist doctrinaire. Have
we not heard Mr Herbert Morrison descant upon his plans to curtail
Parliamentary procedure and pass laws simply by resolutions of
broad principle in the House of Commons, afterwards to be left by
Parliament to the executive and to the bureaucrats to elaborate and
enforce by departmental regulations? As for Sir Stafford Cripps on
'Parliament in the Socialist State', I have not time to read you what
he said, but perhaps it will meet the public eye during the election
campalgn.
But I will go farther. I declare to you, from the bottom of my heart,
that no Socialist system can be established without a political police.
Many of those who are advocating Socialism or voting Socialist
today will be horrified at this idea. That is because they are shortsighted, that is because they do not see where their theories are
leading them.
No Socialist Government conducting the entire life and industry of the country could afford to allow free, sharp, or violently-worded
expressions of public discontent. They would have to fall back on
some form of Gestapo, no doubt very humanely directed in the first
instance. And this would nip opinion in the bud; it would stop
criticism as it reared its head, and it would gather all the power to the
supreme party and the party leaders, rising like stately pinnacles
above their vast bureaucracies of Civil servants, no longer servants
and no longer civil. And where would the ordinary simple folk - the
common people, as they like to call them in America - where would
they be, once this mighty organism had got them in its grip?
I stand for the sovereign freedom of the individual within the laws
which freely elected Parliaments have freely passed. I stand for the
rights of the ordinary man to say what he thinks of the Government
of the day, however powerful, and to turn them out, neck and crop,
if he thinks he can better his temper or his home thereby, and if he
can persuade enough others to vote with him. "
"General Eisenhower, 12 June 1945, Mansion House, London",,"I have been brought very closely in contact with General Eisenhower since the day early in 1942 when we first met at the White House after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and all the grave matters of the direction of the armies to the landings in French North Africa and all the great efforts which were called for a year ago had to be discussed and examined, and I had the opportunity of seeing at close quarters General 'Ike' - for that is what I call him - in action. I saw him at all sorts of times, because in war things do not always go as we wish. Another will breaks in, and there is a clash, and questions arise. Never have I seen a man so staunch in pursuing the purpose in hand, so ready to accept responsibility for misfortune, or so generous in
victory.
There is one moment I would dwell on. It was just about a little
more than a year ago that he had to decide whether to go across the
Channel or put it off for, it might be, eleven days. It was a terrible
decision. The Army had gathered. A million men in the front line had
gathered, and thousands of crafts and tens of thousands of aircraft,
and the great ships were all arranged. You could not hold it. It was
like trying to hold an avalanche in leash. Should it be launched or
should it not be launched?
There were a great many people who had a chance of expressing
their opinions. I was not one of them, because it was purely a
technical matter. A great many generals and admirals were gathered
in the High Command to express their opinions and views, but there
was only one man on whom the awful brunt fell of saying 'Go' or
'Stay'. To say 'Stay' meant keeping hundreds of thousands of men
cooped up in wired enclosures so that the plans they had been told of
might not leak out. It meant the problem of hundreds of thousands
of men on board ship who had to be provided for and found
accommodation. It might have meant that the air could not cover the
landing or that the water was too rough for the many boats that were
needed.
It was one of the most terrible decisions, and this decision was
taken by this man - this very great man (prolonged applause).
It is one of many decisions he has taken. Had he not said 'Go', and
eleven days had passed, the weather would have smiled, and all the
groups of meteorologists would have been happy. The expedition
would have started; and two days later the worst gale for forty years
at that season of the year fell upon the beaches in Normandy. Not
only did he take the risk and arrive at the fence, he cleared it in
magnificent style.
There are many occasions when that kind of decision falls on the
Supreme Commander. Many fearful tales come from the front line. A
great deal of anxiety is felt by populations at home. Do we go
forward? Do we fight in this area? Are we to push on? These
decisions all resolved themselves into an 'Aye' or a 'No', and all I can
say about our guest is that in very many most important decisions
history will acclaim his decisions as right, and that the bias, the
natural bias, that moved him in these matters was very much more in
favour of 'Aye' than of 'No'.
I could go on for a very long time about your guest. There is no
doubt whatever that we have among us today one of the greatest Americans who have reached our shores and dwelt a considerable
time among us. We honour him very much for his invariable
considerations of the British point of view, for his impartial
treatment of all the officers under his command. I know he will tell
you when he rises that he never gave an order to a British officer
which he could not immediately obey.
We also have made our contribution to the battles on the
Continent, and I am quite sure that the influence he will wield in the
world will be one always of bringing our countries together in the
much more difficult task of peace, in the same way as he brought
them together in the grim and awful cataclysm of war. I have had
personal acquaintance with him now for three years. It is not much,
but three years of this sort may seem five-and-twenty. I feel we have
here a great creative, constructive and combining genius, one from
our sister nation across the ocean, one who will never speak evil but
will always cherish his contact with the British people, and to whom
I feel we should at this moment give the most cordial testimony in
our power of our admiration, of our affection, and of our heartfelt
good wishes for everything that may happen to him in the future. "
"'Dear Desert Rats', 21 July 1945, Winston Club, Berlin",,"This morning's parade brings back to my mind a great many moving incidents of these last long, fierce years. Now you are here in Berlin, and I find you established in this great centre which, as a volcano, erupted smoke and fire all over Europe. Twice in our generation as in bygone times the German fury has been unleashed on her neighbours .... I have only one more word to say to the Desert Rats. You were the
first to begin.
The 11th Hussars were in action in the Desert in 1940, and ever
since you have kept marching steadily forward on the long road to
Victory: through so many countries and changing scenes you have
marched and fought your way.
I am unable to speak without emotion. Dear Desert Rats, may
your glory ever shine. May your laurels never fade. May the memory
of this glorious pilgrimage which you have made from Alamein to
the Baltic and Berlin never die. A march - as far as my reading of
history leads me to believe - unsurpassed in the whole story of war.
May fathers long tell their children the tale. May you all feel that
through following your great ancestors you have accomplished
something which has done good to the whole world, which has
raised the honour of your country and of which every man has the
right to feel proud. "
"Resignation, 26 July 1945, 10 Downing Street",,"The decision of the British people has been recorded in the votes
counted today. I have therefore laid down the charge which was
placed upon me in darker times. I regret that I have not been
permitted to finish the work against Japan. For this, however, all
plans and preparations have been made, and the results may come
much quicker than we have hitherto been entitled to expect. Immense
responsibilities abroad and at home fall upon the new Government,
and we must all hope that they will be successful in bearing them.
It only remains for me to express to the British people, for whom I
have acted in these perilous years, my profound gratitude for the
unflinching, unswerving support which they have given me during
my task, and for the many expressions of kindness which they have
shown towards their servant. "
"The atomic bomb, 6 August 1945, 10 Downing Street",,"By the year 1939 it had become widely recognised among scientists
of many nations that the release of energy by atomic fission was a
possibility. The problems which remained to be solved before this
possibility could be turned into practical achievement were, however,
manifold and immense; and few scientists would at that time have
ventured to predict that an atomic bomb could be ready for use by
1945. Nevertheless, the potentialities of the project were so great that
His Majesty's Government thought it right that research should be
carried on in spite of the many competing claims on our scientific
manpower ....
On October 11, 1941, President Roosevelt sent me a letter
suggesting that any extended efforts on this important matter might
usefully be co-ordinated, or even jointly conducted. Accordingly, all
British and American efforts were joined, and a number of British
scientists concerned proceeded to the United States. Apart from these
contacts, complete secrecy guarded all these activities, and no single
person was informed whose work was not indispensable to progress.
By the summer of 1942 this expanded programme of research had
confirmed with surer and broader foundations the promising
forecasts which had been made a year earlier, and the time had come
when a decision must be made whether or not to proceed with the
construction of large-scale production plants. Meanwhile it had
become apparent from the preliminary experiments that these plants
would have to be on something like the vast scale described in the
American statements which have been published today.
Great Britain at this period was fully extended in war production,
and we could not afford such grave interference with the current munitions programmes on which our warlike operations depended.
Moreover, Great Britain was within easy range of German bombers,
and the risk of raiders from the sea or air could not be ignored. The
United States, however, wh~re parallel or similar progress had been
made, was free from these dangers. The decision was therefore taken
to build the full-scale production plants in America.
In the United States the erection of the immense plants was placed
under the responsibility of Mr Stimson, United States Secretary of
War, and the American Army Administration, whose wonderful
work and marvellous secrecy cannot be sufficiently admired. The
main practical effort and virtually the whole of its prodigious cost
now fell upon the United States authorities, who were assisted by a
number of British scientists. The relationship of the British and
American contributions was regulated by discussion between the late
President Roosevelt and myself, and a combined policy committee
was set up ....
By God's mercy British and American science outpaced all German
efforts. These were on 8 considerable scale, but far behind. The
possession of these powers by the Germans at any time might have
altered the result of the war, and profound anxiety was felt by those
who were informed. Every effort was made by our Intelligence
Service and by the Air Force to locate in Germany anything
resembling the plants which were being created in the United States.
In the winter of 1942-43 most gallant attacks were made in Norway
on two occasions by small parties of volunteers from the British
Commandos and Norwegian forces, at very heavy loss of life, upon
stores of what is called 'heavy water', an element in one of the
possible processes. The second of these two attacks was completely
successful.
The whole burden of execution, including the setting-up of the
plants and many technical processes connected therewith in the
practical sphere, constitutes one of the greatest triumphs of American
- or indeed human - genius of which there is record. Moreover, the
decision to make these enormous expenditures upon a project which,
however hopefully established by American and British research,
remained nevertheless a heart-shaking risk, stands to the everlasting
honour of President Roosevelt and his advisers.
It is now for Japan to realise, in the glare of the first atomic bomb
which has smitten her, what the consequences will be of an indefinite
continuance of this terrible means of maintaining a rule of law in the
world.
This revelation of the secrets of nature, long mercifully withheld from man, should arouse the most solemn reflections in the mind and
conscience of every human being capable of comprehension. We
must indeed pray that these awful agencies will be made to conduce
to peace among the nations, and that instead of wreaking measureless havoc upon the entire globe they may become a perennial
fountain of world prosperity. "
"Surrender of Japan, 15 August 1945, House of Commons",,"This crowning deliverance from the long and anxious years of danger and carnage should rightly be celebrated by Parliament in accordance with custom and tradition.

"'Government of the people', 16 August 1945, House of Commons",,"In those countries, torn and convulsed by war, there may be, for some months to come, the need of authoritarian government. The alternative would be anarchy. Therefore it would be unreasonable to ask or expect that liberal government - as spelt with a small'!, - and British or United States democratic conditions, should be instituted immediately. They take their politics very seriously in those countries. A friend of mine, an officer, was in Zagreb when the results of the late General Election came in. An old lady said to him, 'Poor Mr Churchill! I suppose now he will be shot.' My friend was able to reassure her. He said the sentence might be mitigated to one of the various forms of hard labour which are always open to His Majesty's subjects. Nevertheless we must know where we stand, and we must make clear where we stand, in these affairs of the Balkans and of Eastern Europe, and indeed of any country which comes into this field. Our ideal is government of the people, by the people, for the people - the people being free without duress to express, by secret ballot without intimidation, their deep-seated wish as to the form and conditions of the Government under which they are to live."
"Alamein, 25 October 1945, Royal Albert Hall, London",,"It is of Monty, as I have been for some time allowed to call him, that I speak especially tonight. The advances of the Eighth Army under his command will ever be a glittering episode in the martial annals of Britain and, not only of Britain but, as the Field Marshal has said, of the mighty array of Commonwealth and Empire which gathered around this small island and found its representation in all the desert battles. Field Marshal Montgomery is one of the greatest living masters of the art of war. Like Stonewall Jackson, he was a professor and teacher of the military science before he became an actor on the world stage. It has been my fortune and great pleasure often to be with him at important moments in the long march from Mersa Matruh to the Rhine. Either on the eve of great battles, or while the struggle was actually in progress, always I have found the same buoyant, vigorous, efficienr personality with every aspect of the vast operation in his mind, and every unit of mighty armies in his grip. He is now discharging a task of enormous responsibility and difficulty in the administr3tion of shattered and ruined Germany and we look to him to help those misguided and now terribly smitten people through the sombre winter which is approaching. I cannot doubt that after that he has further first-rate contributions to make to the future structure of the British Army. I therefore feel it an honour that he should have proposed my health and that he should have wished to associate me here with the Eighth Army and its glorious victory."
"WE DID NOT FLINCH; WE DID NOT FAIL',31 October 1945,Harrow School ",,"As a youth, I always wanted to play the kettledrum, and when that could not be arranged I thought I would like to be leader of the school orchestra. That could not be arranged either, but eventually, and after a great deal of perseverance I rose to be the conductor of quite a considerable band. It was a very large band and played very strange and formidable instruments. The roar and thunder of its music resounded throughout the world. We played all sorts of tunes, and we finished up the concert with 'Rule, Britannia!' and 'God save the King.' ... (Cheers.) This is a time when the voice of youth will be welcomed in the world. We have come out of this struggle in many ways impoverished and with many burdens and the future is by no means clear. Always remember you are citizens of a country which holds its own in the very foremost ranks of the nations of the world and is entitled to receive from all of them a tribute of respect, because it was on our country that the whole brunt of the burden fell for more than a year of saving civilisation and the world. We did not flinch, we did not fail."
"'The unnecessary war', 16 November 1945, Belgian Parliament, Brussels",,"The ties between Great Britain and Belgium found their culmination in the great struggle from 1914-1918. It was hoped that the wars were over. Yet we have witnessed an even more destructive worldwide struggle. Need we have done so? I have no doubt whatever that
firm guidance and united action on the part of the Victorious Powers
would have prevented this last catastrophe. President Roosevelt one
day asked what this war should be called. My answer was, 'The
Unnecessary War.' If the United States had taken an active part in the
League of Nations, and if the League of Nations had been prepared
to use concerted force, even had it only been European force, to
prevent the rearmament of Germany, there was no need for further
serious bloodshed. If the Allies had resisted Hitler strongly in his
early stages, even up to his seizure of the Rhineland in 1936, he
would have been forced to recoil, and a chance would have been
given to the same elements in German life, which were very powerful
especially in the High Command, to free Germany of the maniacal
Government and system into the grip of which she was falling.
Do not forget that twice the German people, by a majority, voted
against Hitler, but the Allies and the League of Nations acted with
such feebleness and lack of clairvoyance, that each of Hitler's
encroachments became a triumph for him over all moderate and
restraining forces until, finally, we resigned ourselves without further
protest to the vast process of German rearmament and war
preparation which ended in a renewed outbreak of destructive war.
Let us profit at least by this terrible lesson. In vain did I attempt to
teach it before the war. that constancy of mind, persistency of purpose, and the grand
simplicity of decision shall guide and rule the conduct of the Englishspeaking peoples in peace as they did in war. We must, and I believe
we shall, prove ourselves equal to this severe requirement.
When American military men approach some serious situation
they are wont to write at the head of their directive the words 'overall strategic concept'. There is wisdom in this, as it leads to clarity of
thought. What then is the over-all strategic concept which we should
inscribe today? It is nothing less than the safety and welfare, the
freedom and progress, of all the homes and families of all the men
and women in all the lands. And here I speak particularly of the
myriad cottage or apartment homes where the wage-earner strives
amid the accidents and difficulties of life to guard his wife and
children from privation and bring the family up in the fear of the
Lord, or upon ethical conceptions which often play their potent part.
To give security to these countless homes, they must be shielded
from the two giant marauders, war and tyranny. We all know the
frightful disturbances in whIch the ordinary family is plunged when
the curse of war swoop~ down upon the breadwinner and those for
whom he works and contrives. The awful ruin of Europe, with all its
vanished glories, and of large parts of Asia glares us in the eyes.
When the designs of wicked men or the aggressive urge of mighty
States dissolve over large areas the frame of civilised society, humble
folk are confronted with difficulties with which they cannot cope.
For them all is distorted, all is broken, even ground to pulp.
When I stand here this quiet afternoon I shudder to visualise what
is actually happening to millions now and what is going to happen in
this period when famine stalks the earth. None can compute what
has been called 'the unestimated sum of human pain'. Our supreme
task and duty is to guard the homes of the common people from the
horrors and miseries of another war. We are all agreed on that.
Our American military colleagues, after having proclaimed their
'over-all strategic concept' and computed available resources, always
proceed to the next step - namely, the method. Here again there is
widespread agreement. A world organisation has already been
erected for the prime purpose of preventing war. UNO, the successor
of the League of Nations, with the decisive addition of the United
States and all that that means, is already at work. We must make
sure that its work is fruitful, that it is a reality and not a sham, that it
is a force for action, and not merely a frothing of words, that it is a
true temple of peace in which the shields of many nations can some
day be hung up, and not merely a cockpit in a Tower of Babel. Before we cast away the solid assurances of national armaments for
self-preservation we must be certain that our temple is built, not
upon shifting sands or quagmires, but upon the rock. Anyone can see
with his eyes open that our path will be difficult and also long, but if
we persevere together as we did in the two world wars - though not,
alas, in the interval between them - I cannot doubt that we shall
achieve our common purpose in the end.
I have, however, a definite and practical proposal to make for
action. Courts and magistrates may be set up but they cannot
function without sheriffs and constables. The United Nations
Organisation must immediately begin to be equipped with an
international armed force. In such a matter we can only go step by
step, but we must begin now. I propose that each of the Powers and
States should be invited to delegate a certain number of air
squadrons to the service of the world organisation. These squadrons
would be trained and prepared in their own countries, but would
move around in rotation from one country to another. They would
wear the uniform of their own countries but with different badges.
They would not be required to act against their own nation, but in
other respects they would be directed by the world organisation. This
might be started on a modest scale and would grow as confidence
grew. I wished to see this done after the First World War, and I
devoutly trust it may be done forthwith.
It would nevertheless be wrong and imprudent to entrust the secret
knowledge or experience of the atomic bomb, which the United
States, Great Britain, and Canada now share, to the world organisation, while it is still in its infancy. It would be criminal madness to
cast it adrift in this still agitated and un-united world. No one in any
country has slept less well in their beds because this knowledge and
the method and the raw materials to apply it are at present largely
retained in American hands. I do not believe we should all have slept
so soundly had the positions been reversed and if some Communist
or neo-Fascist State monopolised for the time being these dread
agencies. The fear of them alone might easily have been used to
enforce totalitarian systems upon the free democratic world, with
consequences appalling to human imagination. God has willed that
this shall not be and we have at least a breathing space to set our
house in order before this peril has to be encountered: and even then,
if no effort is spared, we should still possess so formidable a
superiority as to impose effective deterrents upon its employment, or
threat of employment, by others. Ultimately, when the essential
brotherhood of man is truly embodied and expressed in a world"
"An Iron Curtain has descended', 5 March 1946, Fulton, Missouri",,"I am glad to come to Westminster College this afternoon, and am complimented that you should give me a degree. The name 'Westminster' is somehow familiar to me. I seem to have heard of it before. Indeed, it was at Westminster that I received a very large part of my education in politics, dialectic, rhetoric, and one or two other things. In fact we have both been educated at the same, or similar, or, at any rate, kindred establishments. It is also a honour, perhaps almost unique, for a private visitor to be introduced to an academic audience by the President of the United States. Amid his heavy burdens, duties, and responsibilities - unsought but not recoiled from - the President has travelled a thousand miles to dignify and magnify our meeting here today and to give me an opportunity of addressing this kindred nation, as well as my own countrymen across the ocean, and perhaps some other countries too. The President has told you that it is his wish, as I am sure it is yours, that I should have full liberty to give my true and faithful counsel in these anxious and baffling times. I shall certainly avail myself of this freedom, and feel the more right to do so because any private ambitions I may have cherished in my younger days have been satisfied beyond my wildest dreams. Let me, however, make it clear that I have no official mission or status of any kind, and that I speak only for myself. There is nothing here but what you see. I can therefore allow my mind, with the experience of a lifetime, to play over the problems which beset us on the morrow of our absolute victory in arms, and to try to make sure with what strength I have that what has been gained with so much sacrifice and suffering shall be preserved for the future glory and safety of mankind. The United States stands at this time at the pinnacle of world power. It is a solemn moment for the American Democracy. For with primacy in power is also joined an awe-inspiring accountability to the future. If you look around you, you must feel not only the sense of duty done but also you must feel anxiety lest you fall below the level of achievement. Opportunity is here now, clear and shining for both our countries. To reject it or ignore it or fritter it away will bring upon us all the long reproaches of the after-time. It is necessary that constancy of mind, persistency of purpose, and the grand
simplicity of decision shall guide and rule the conduct of the Englishspeaking peoples in peace as they did in war. We must, and I believe
we shall, prove ourselves equal to this severe requirement.
When American military men approach some serious situation
they are wont to write at the head of their directive the words 'overall strategic concept'. There is wisdom in this, as it leads to clarity of
thought. What then is the over-all strategic concept which we should
inscribe today? It is nothing less than the safety and welfare, the
freedom and progress, of all the homes and families of all the men
and women in all the lands. And here I speak particularly of the
myriad cottage or apartment homes where the wage-earner strives
amid the accidents and difficulties of life to guard his wife and
children from privation and bring the family up in the fear of the
Lord, or upon ethical conceptions which often play their potent part.
To give security to these countless homes, they must be shielded
from the two giant marauders, war and tyranny. We all know the
frightful disturbances in whIch the ordinary family is plunged when
the curse of war swoop~ down upon the breadwinner and those for
whom he works and contrives. The awful ruin of Europe, with all its
vanished glories, and of large parts of Asia glares us in the eyes.
When the designs of wicked men or the aggressive urge of mighty
States dissolve over large areas the frame of civilised society, humble
folk are confronted with difficulties with which they cannot cope. British Commonwealth and in the United States where Communism
is in its infancy, the Communist parties or fifth columns constitute a
growing challenge and peril to Christian civilisation. These are
sombre facts for anyone to have to recite on the morrow of a victory
gained by so much splendid comradeship in arms and in the cause of
freedom and democracy; but we should be most unwise not to face
them squarely while time remains.
The outlook is also anxious in the Far East and especially in
Manchuria. The Agreement which was made at Yalta, to which I was
a party, was extremely favourable to Soviet Russia, but it was made
at a time when no one could say that the German war might not
extend all through the summer and autumn of 1945 and when the
Japanese war was expected to last for a further 18 months from the
end of the German war. In this country you are all so well informed
about the Far East, and such devoted friends of China, that I do not
need to expatiate on the situation there.
I have felt bound to portray the shadow which, alike in the west
and in the east, falls upon the world. I was a high minister at the time
of the Versailles Treaty and a close friend of Mr Lloyd George, who
was the head of the British delegation at Versailles. I did not myself
agree with many things that were done, but I have a very strong
impression in my mind of that situation, and I find it painful to
contrast it with that which prevails now. In those days there were
high hopes and unbounded confidence that the wars were over, and
that the League of Nations would become all-powerful. I do not see
or feel that same confidence or even the same hopes in the haggard
world at the present time.
On the other hand I repulse the idea that a new war is inevitable;
still more that it is imminent. It is because I am sure that our fortunes
are still in our own hands and that we hold the power to save the
future, that I feel the duty to speak out now that I have the occasion
and the opportunity to do so. I do not believe that Soviet Russia
desires war. What they desire is the fruits of war and the indefinite
expansion of their power and doctrines. But what we have to
consider here today while time remains is the permanent prevention
of war and the establishment of conditions of freedom and
democracy as rapidly as possible in all countries. Our difficulties and
dangers will not be removed by closing our eyes to them. They will
not be removed by mere waiting to see what happens; nor will they
be removed by a policy of appeasement. What is needed is a
settlement, and the longer this is delayed, the more difficult it will be
and the greater our dangers will become. From what I have seen of our Russian friends and Allies during the
war, I am convinced that there is nothing they admire so much as
strength, and there is nothing for which they have less respect than
for weakness, especially military weakness. For that reason the old
doctrine of a balance of power is unsound. We cannot afford, if we
can help it, to work on narrow margins, offering temptations to a
trial of strength. If the Western Democracies stand together in strict
adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter, their
influence for furthering those principles will be immense and no one
is likely to molest them. If however they become divided or falter in
their duty and if these all-important years are allowed to slip away
then indeed catastrophe may overwhelm us all.
Last time I saw it all coming and cried aloud to my own fellowcountrymen and to the world, but no one paid any attention. Up till
the year 1933 or even 1935, Germany might have been saved from
the awful fate which has overtaken her and we might all have been
spared the miseries Hitler let loose upon mankind. There never was a
war in all history eC1.sier to prevent by timely action than the one
which has just desolated such great areas of the globe. It could have
been prevented in my belief without the firing of a single shot, and
Germany might be powerful, prosperous and honoured today; but
no one would listen and one by one we were all sucked into the awful
whirlpool. We surely must not let that happen again. This can only
be achieved by reaching now, in 1946, a good understanding on all
points with Russia under the general authority of the United Nations
Organisation and by the maintenance of that good understanding
through many peaceful years, by the world instrument, supported by
the whole strength of the English-speaking world and all its
connections. There is the solution which I respectfully offer to you in
this Address to which I have given the title 'The Sinews of Peace'.
Let no man underrate the abiding power of the British Empire and
Commonwealth. Because you see the 46 millions in our island
harassed about their food supply, of which they only grow one half,
even in wartime, or because we have difficulty in restarting our
industries and export trade after six years of passionate war effort,
do not suppose that we shall not come through these dark years of
privation as we have come through the glorious years of agony, or
that half a century from now, you will not see 70 or 80 millions of
Britons spread about the world and united in defence of our
traditions, our way of life, and of the world causes which you and we
espouse. If the population of the English-speaking Commonwealths
be added to that of the United States with all that such co-operation implies in the air, on the sea, all over the globe and in science and in
industry, and in moral force, there will be no quivering, precarious
balance of power to offer its temptation to ambition or adventure.
On the contrary, there will be an overwhelming assurance of
security. If we adhere faithfully to the Charter of the United Nations
and walk forward in sedate and sober strength seeking no one's land
or treasure, seeking to lay no arbitrary control upon the thoughts of
men; if all British moral and material forces and convictions are
joined with your own in fraternal association, the highroads of the
future will be clear, not only for us but for all, not only for our time,
but for a century to come. 
For them all is distorted, all is broken, even ground to pulp.
When I stand here this quiet afternoon I shudder to visualise what
is actually happening to millions now and what is going to happen in
this period when famine stalks the earth. None can compute what
has been called 'the unestimated sum of human pain'. Our supreme
task and duty is to guard the homes of the common people from the
horrors and miseries of another war. We are all agreed on that.
Our American military colleagues, after having proclaimed their
'over-all strategic concept' and computed available resources, always
proceed to the next step - namely, the method. Here again there is
widespread agreement. A world organisation has already been
erected for the prime purpose of preventing war. UNO, the successor
of the League of Nations, with the decisive addition of the United
States and all that that means, is already at work. We must make
sure that its work is fruitful, that it is a reality and not a sham, that it
is a force for action, and not merely a frothing of words, that it is a
true temple of peace in which the shields of many nations can some
day be hung up, and not merely a cockpit in a Tower of Babel. Before we cast away the solid assurances of national armaments for
self-preservation we must be certain that our temple is built, not
upon shifting sands or quagmires, but upon the rock. Anyone can see
with his eyes open that our path will be difficult and also long, but if
we persevere together as we did in the two world wars - though not,
alas, in the interval between them - I cannot doubt that we shall
achieve our common purpose in the end.
I have, however, a definite and practical proposal to make for
action. Courts and magistrates may be set up but they cannot
function without sheriffs and constables. The United Nations
Organisation must immediately begin to be equipped with an
international armed force. In such a matter we can only go step by
step, but we must begin now. I propose that each of the Powers and
States should be invited to delegate a certain number of air
squadrons to the service of the world organisation. These squadrons
would be trained and prepared in their own countries, but would
move around in rotation from one country to another. They would
wear the uniform of their own countries but with different badges.
They would not be required to act against their own nation, but in
other respects they would be directed by the world organisation. This
might be started on a modest scale and would grow as confidence
grew. I wished to see this done after the First World War, and I
devoutly trust it may be done forthwith.
It would nevertheless be wrong and imprudent to entrust the secret
knowledge or experience of the atomic bomb, which the United
States, Great Britain, and Canada now share, to the world organisation, while it is still in its infancy. It would be criminal madness to
cast it adrift in this still agitated and un-united world. No one in any
country has slept less well in their beds because this knowledge and
the method and the raw materials to apply it are at present largely
retained in American hands. I do not believe we should all have slept
so soundly had the positions been reversed and if some Communist
or neo-Fascist State monopolised for the time being these dread
agencies. The fear of them alone might easily have been used to
enforce totalitarian systems upon the free democratic world, with
consequences appalling to human imagination. God has willed that
this shall not be and we have at least a breathing space to set our
house in order before this peril has to be encountered: and even then,
if no effort is spared, we should still possess so formidable a
superiority as to impose effective deterrents upon its employment, or
threat of employment, by others. Ultimately, when the essential
brotherhood of man is truly embodied and expressed in a world organisation with all the necessary practical safeguards to make it
effective, these powers would naturally be confided to that world
organisation.
Now I come to the second danger of these two marauders which
threaten the cottage, the home, and the ordinary people - namely,
tyranny. We cannot be blind to the fact that the liberties enjoyed by
individual citizens throughout the British Empire are not valid in a
considerable number of countries, some of which are very powerful.
In these States control is enforced upon the common people by various
kinds of all-embracing police governments. The power of the State is
exercised without restraint, either by dictators or by compact
oligarchies operating through a privileged party and a political police.
It is not our duty at this time when difficulties are so numerous to
interfere forcibly in th~ internal affairs of countries which we have not
conquered in war. But we must never cease to proclaim in fearless
tones the great principles of freedom and the rights of man which are
the joint inheritance of the English-speaking world and which through
Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Habeas Corpus, trial by jury, and
the English common law find their most famous expression in the
American Declaration of Independence.
All this means that the people of any country have the right, and
should have the power by constitutional action, by free unfettered
elections, with secret ballot, to choose or change the character or
form of government under which they dwell; that freedom of speech
and thought should reign; that courts of justice, independent of the
executive, unbiased by any party, should administer laws which have
received the broad assent of large majorities or are consecrated by
time and custom. Here are the title deeds of freedom which should lie
in every cottage home. Here is the message of the British and
American peoples to mankind. Let us preach what we practise - let
us practise what we preach.
I have now stated the two great dangers which menace the homes
of the people: War and Tyranny. I have not yet spoken of poverty
and privation which are in many cases the prevailing anxiety. But if
the dangers of war and tyranny are removed, there is no doubt that
science and co-operation can bring in the next few years to the
world, certainly in the next few decades newly taught in the
sharpening school of war, an expansion of material well-being
beyond anything that has yet occurred in human experience. Now, at
this sad and breathless moment, we are plunged in the hunger and
distress which are the aftermath of our stupendous struggle; but this
will pass and may pass quickly, and there is no reason except human folly or sub-human crime which should deny to all the nations the
inauguration and enjoyment of an age of plenty. I have often used
words which I learned fifty years ago from a great Irish-American
orator, a friend of mine, Mr Bourke Cockran. 'There is enough for
all. The earth is a generous mother; she will provide in plentiful
abundance food for all her children if they will but cultivate her soil
in justice and in peace.' So far I feel that we are in full agreement.
Now, while still pursuing the method of realising our overall
strategic concept, I come to the crux of what I have travelled here to
say. Neither the sure prevention of war, nor the continuous rise of
world organisation will be gained without what I have called the
fraternal association of the English-speaking peoples. This means a
special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire
and the United States. This is no time for generalities, and I will
venture to be precise. Fraternal association requires not only the
growing friendship and mutual understanding between our two vast
but kindred systems of society, but the continuance of the intimate
relationship between our military advisers, leading to common study
of potential dangers, the similarity of weapons and manuals of
instructions, and to the interchange of officers and cadets at technical
colleges. It should carry with it the continuance of the present
facilities for mutual security by the joint use of all Naval and Air
Force bases in the possession of either country all over the world.
This would perhaps double the mobility of the American Navy and
Air Force. It would greatly expand that of the British Empire Forces
and it might well lead, if and as the world calms down, to important
financial savings. Already we use together a large number of islands;
more may well be entrusted to our joint care in the near future.
The United States has already a Permanent Defence Agreement
with the Dominion of Canada, which is so devotedly attached to the
British Commonwealth and Empire. This Agreement is more effective than many of those which have often been made under formal
alliances. This principle should be extended to all British Commonwealths with full reciprocity. Thus, whatever happens, and thus only,
shall we be secure ourselves and able to work together for the high
and simple causes that are dear to us and bode no ill to any.
Eventually there may come - I feel eventually there will come - the
principle of common citizenship, but that we may be content to leave
to destiny, whose outstretched arm many of us can already clearly
see.
There is however an important question we must ask ourselves.
Would a special relationship between the United States and the British Commonwealth be inconsistent with our overriding loyalties
to the World Organisation? I reply that, on the contrary, it is
probably the only means by which that organisation will achieve its
full stature and strength. There are already the special United States
relations with Canada which I have just mentioned, and there are the
special relations between the United States and the South American
Republics. We British have our twenty years Treaty of Collaboration
and Mutual Assistance with Soviet Russia. I agree with Mr Bevin, the
Foreign Secretary of Great Britain, that it might well be a fifty years
Treaty so far as we are concerned. We aim at nothing but mutual
assistance and collaboration. The British have an alliance with
Portugal unbroken since 1384, and which produced fruitful results at
critical moments in the late war. None of these clash with the general
interest of a world agreement, or a world organisation; on the
contrary they help it. 'In my father's house are many mansions.'
Special associations between members of the United Nations which
have no aggressive point against any other country, which harbour
no design incompatible with the Charter of the United Nations, far
from being harmful, ar~ beneficial and, as I believe, indispensable.
I spoke earlier of the Temple of Peace. Workmen from all countries
must build that temple. If two of the workmen know each other
particularly well and are old friends, if their families are intermingled, and if they have 'faith in each other's purpose, hope in each
other's future and charity towards each other's shortcomings' - to
quote some good words I read here the other day - why cannot they
work together at the common task as friends and partners? Why
cannot they share their tools and thus increase each other's working
powers? Indeed they must do so or else the temple may not be built,
or, being built, it may collapse, and we shall all be proved again
unteachable and have to go and try to learn again for a third time in
a school of war, incomparably more rigorous than that from which
we have just been released. The dark ages may return, the Stone Age
may return on the glittering wings of science, and what might now
shower immeasurable material blessings upon mankind, may even
bring about its total destruction. Beware, I say; time may be short.
Do not let us take the course of allowing events to drift along until it
is too late. If there is to be a fraternal association of the kind I have
described, with all the extra strength and security which both our
countries can derive from it, let us make sure that that great fact is
known to the world, and that it plays its part in steadying and
stabilising the foundations of peace. There is the path of wisdom.
Prevention is better than cure. A shadow has fallen upon the scenes so lately lighted by the Allied
victory. Nobody knows what Soviet Russia and its Communist
international organisation intends to do in the immediate future, or
what are the limits, if any, to their expansive and proselytising
tendencies. I have a strong admiration and regard for the valiant
Russian people and for my wartime comrade, Marshal Stalin. There
is deep sympathy and goodwill in Britain - and I doubt not here also
- towards the peoples of all the Russias and a resolve to persevere
through many differences and rebuffs in establishing lasting friendships. We understand the Russian need to be secure on her western
frontiers by removal of all possibility of German aggression. We
welcome Russia to her rightful place among the leading nations of
the world. We welcome her flag upon the seas. Above all, we
welcome constant, freqvent and growing contacts between the
Russian people and our own people on both sides of the Atlantic. It
is my duty however, for I am sure you would wish me to state the
facts as I see them to you, to place before you certain facts about the
present position in Europe.
From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain
has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the
capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw,
Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia, all
these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I
must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject in one form or
another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and, in many
cases, increasing measure of control from Moscow. Athens alone -
Greece with its immortal glories - is free to decide its future at an
election under British, American and French observation. The
Russian-dominated Polish Government has been encouraged to make
enormous and wrongful inroads upon Germany, and mass expulsions of millions of Germans on a scale grievous and undreamed-of
are now taking place. The Communist parties, which were very small
in all these Eastern States of Europe, have been raised to preeminence and power far beyond their numbers and are seeking
everywhere to obtain totalitarian control. Police governments are
prevailing in nearly every case, and so far, except in Czechoslovakia,
there is no true democracy.
Turkey and Persia are both profoundly alarmed and disturbed at
the claims which are being made upon them and at the pressure being
exerted by the Moscow Government. An attempt is being made by
the Russians in Berlin to build up a quasi-Communist party in their
zone of Occupied Germany by showing special favours to groups of left-wing German leaders. At the end of the fighting last June, the
American and British Armies withdrew westwards, in accordance
with an earlier agreement, to a depth at some points of 150 miles
upon a front of nearly 400 miles, in order to allow our Russian allies
to occupy this vast expanse of territory which the Western Democracies had conquered.
If now the Soviet Government tries, by separate action, to build up
a pro-Communist Germany in their areas, this will cause new serious
difficulties in the British and American zones, and will give the
defeated Germans the power of putting themselves up to auction
between the Soviets and the Western Democracies. Whatever
conclusions may be drawn from these facts - and facts they are - this
is certainly not the Liberated Europe we fought to build up. Nor is it
one which contains the essentials of permanent peace.
The safety of the world requires a new unity in Europe, from
which no nation should be permanently outcast. It is from the
quarrels of the strong parent races in Europe that the world wars we
have witnessed, or which occurred in former times, have sprung.
Twice in our own lifetime we have seen the United States, against
their wishes and their traditions, against arguments, the force of
which it is impossible not to comprehend, drawn by irresistible
forces into these wars in time to secure the victory of the good cause,
but only after frightful slaughter and devastation had occurred.
Twice the United States has had to send several millions of its young
men across the Atlantic to find the war; but now war can find any
nation, wherever it may dwell between dusk and dawn. Surely we
should work with conscious purpose for a grand pacification of
Europe, within the structure of the United Nations and in accordance
with its Charter. That I feel is an open cause of policy of very great
importance.
In front of the iron curtain which lies across Europe are other
causes for anxiety. In Italy the Communist Party is seriously
hampered by having to support the Communist-trained Marshal
Tito's claims to former Italian territory at the head of the Adriatic.
Nevertheless the future of Italy hangs in the balance. Again one
cannot imagine a regenerated Europe without a strong France. All
my public life I have worked for a strong France and I never lost faith
in her destiny, even in the darkest hours. I will not lose faith now.
However, in a great number of countries, far from the Russian
frontiers and throughout the world, Communist fifth columns are
established and work in complete unity and absolute obedience to
the directions they receive from the Communist centre. Except in the "
