# Factors-that-contributed-to-the-outcome-of-World-War-2-using-topic-modelling-and-GIS

World War 2 (WW2) is known to this day as the deadliest war in history. Other than the 
estimated death toll between 70 and 85 million, the impact of this event has influenced the 
global economy, the technological advancements, and the political dynamic of our world 
today. Even though we have just marked 77 years since the end of WW2, it is important to 
understand the historical significance of this tragedy and how we can learn from it in the 
present day. As George Santayana said, “Those who cannot remember the past are 
condemned to repeat it” and we will follow this quote to support our motivation for this 
report: investigating the factors that contributed to the outcome of WW2. This is especially 
relevant whilst we are approaching tensions between many superpowers today. As we 
are developing in the technological era, computational modelling has been successful for 
improving our analysis and understanding of large and complex data, which we did not have 
the advantage of using in the past. Therefore, by using computational topic modelling and GIS on 
historical data, we aim to effectively shed light on how key drivers of the war, such as 
military resources and leadership, influenced the overall death toll and the success of the 
allies over the axis.
